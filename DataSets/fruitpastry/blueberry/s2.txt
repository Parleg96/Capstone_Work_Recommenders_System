how to make a delicious blueberry cake recipe1 in a medium bowl sift together the all purpose flour baking powder 
and salt set it aside

2 save 1 tablespoon of the sifted flour mix to coat the blueberries
tossing the blueberries with a spoonful of flour will keep them evenly
distributed throughout the baked cake

3 next in the bowl of your stand mixer cream butter and sugar for 3 4
minutes until light and fluffy

4 mix in cream cheese and blend until well incorporated

5 time to add your eggs one at a time to avoid the eggy taste in cakes 
add eggs one by one make sure the first one is blended well into the mix
before the second one goes in

6 lemon zest is nextmix the dry ingredients with wet
ingredients data image/svg xml 3csvg 20xmlns http //wwww3org/2000/svg 20viewbox 0 200 20600 20450 3e 3c/svg 3emix

7 mix wet ingredients into dry ingredients until just combined

8 now fold in the berries coated with flour in the previous step into
the cake batter

preheated oven 350 degrees f for 45 minutes

11 before placing the bundt pan in the oven tap the cake pan on the
counter couple of times this will pop all the bubbles and help in the rising

tips to consider while making this blueberry cake recipeto prevent the batter from turning blue toss blueberries in a
tablespoon of dry flour follow this simple trick and you will taste
blueberries in every bite you take this will absorb some of the liquid
released from the fruit preventing it from sinking to the bottom of the cake

frozen blueberries can be used instead of fresh ones but remember to
coat them in flour before adding to the batter to avoid sinking if you choose
to use frozen berries add them to your mixture completely frozen do not
defrost your berries

you can swap fresh blueberries with any fruit some tested and tried
options are raspberries chopped strawberries blackberries mixed berries 
even apples and it tastes divine

lemon zest make sure you use the outer skin the yellow part of the
lemon do not grate the white part as it tastes bitter

do not overmix the batter overmixing allows the gluten to develop 
and that will result in a dense cake

grease the bundt pan well butter it up in all corners/creases and in
the center to avoid stickingslice of cake with

can i bake this cake in a rectangular panabsolutelyyou can bake this blueberry cake in a 95 5 inch loaf pan baking time
will vary therefore start keeping a watch on the cake around 38 minutes into
baking

after the time is done check the center of the cake by inserting a toothpick
if it comes out clean it s done if not you can bake for some more time

how can i store the leftover cakethis cake stays good at room temperature for 24 hours after that the
leftover blueberry cake needs to be refrigerated

it stays good for 5 6 days in the refrigerator in an airtight container trust
me the chilled cake tastes equally greatfreshly baked blueberry loaf

how to make blueberry turnoversget your puff pastry out of the fridge and let it thaw according to the
directions on the package preheat the oven and line a baking sheet with
parchment paper

then you re ready to make your blueberry sauce in a small sauce pan add
blueberries sugar cornstarch and water and gently stir them together let
the mixture heat over medium and let it cook for a couple minutes until the
mixture starts to get nice and bubbly and slightly thickened remove the pot
from the heat and let the sauce cool

cut your puff pastry dough into squares down the middle 4 squares per sheet
spoon 1 to 2 tbs of the blueberry filling into the middle of each square

whisk together the water and egg in a small bowl and then brush egg wash over
the edges of each of the pastries fold the pastry squares in half to make a
triangle press the edges together with your fingers or with a fork pierce
the top of each turnover with a pork of knife to let the steam escape when
they are cooking

dough and filling brush the remaining egg wash over the top of the turnovers

tips for making the best turnovers 

you could also make these with fresh raspberries or blackberries instead of blueberries
if your berries aren t particularly sweet add 1 extra tablespoon or 2 of sugar to the berry mixture 
don t overfill the turnovers you want to keep the edges mostly sealed so the filling doesn t all leak out of the middle
instead of adding the glaze after you brush the tops of the pastries with the egg wash you can sprinkle them with granulated sugar or coarse sugara blueberry turnover cut in half to show the flaky layers and the blueberry

powdered sugar will soak into the pastry when baked so if you want them extra
sweet you can add it but you can also leave the extra sugar off

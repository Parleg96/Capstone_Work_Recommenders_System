these warm pies cold cream i ate all of them can you blame mei m writing this from the airplane yesen route back from miami via
montreal getting there three days ago took three take offs and landings and
about 15 hours due to a troublemaking funnel cloud but it was worth it to
spend the weekend with em spreading the word about our oh so good for you
canadian lentils among those who like to write about food catching up with a
few of my favourite people and checking out the spectacle that is miami beach
i was the pastiest legged one there

em is sitting cautiously in the seat beside me not moving much so as to
minimize contact with her lobster esque canadian skinblueberry galettes 5 https //wwwdinnerwithjuliecom/wp

but i wanted to share these pies with you i used to think chocolate was my
preferred dessert category and i m still fully in love with a good chocolate
chunk cookie or brownie or squidgy chocolate cake but there really are few
better things in this world than a sweet tart juicy berry pie topped with
thick whipped cream or ice creamblueberry galettes 6 https //wwwdinnerwithjuliecom/wp

these are what i want danish to be insofar as they re made with frozen puff
pastry but the ratio of fruit to crust is more in keeping with my pastry
ideals than the usual breakfast slab with the dab of rubbery fruit goo in the
middle fold over the sides of the pastry and they ll puff up to enclose the
berries as they pop and release their juicesbluebery galette collage https //wwwdinnerwithjuliecom/wp

they re so easy and breezy and summery like all the flimsy dresses on miami
beach they re good for eating in flip flops in case blueberry juices 
gravity conspire against youblueberry galettes 10 https //wwwdinnerwithjuliecom/wp

and when the warm pies come into contact with cold creamheavenblueberry galettes 11 https //wwwdinnerwithjuliecom/wp

i m sure this is one of those recipes you can keep forever in your back
pocket to pull out and use with raspberries blackberries or chunks of peach 
or whatever inspires you to get into the kitchen and make something delicious 
without spending too much time inside

you introduced me to galettes with your blueberry galette in swerve a few
years ago they are so easy and versatile and can be made with puff pastry or
regular pie dough and as a sweet or savory version also you get a more
filling to crust ratio plus it s ok and wonderful even that they look
rustic thank you6https //securegravatarcom/avatar/ s 60 d mm r g

i made these last night i couldn t serve them right away but i microwaved
them for about 15 seconds topped with whipped cream i think next time i
will cut back on the lemon juice maybe 1/2or do 1 tsp vs 1 tbspthey were
very tart i was hoping for more of a sweeter pie i used fresh blueberries
that we had picked everyone gobbled them up though and i had one for
breakfast because who can resist thesevery easy to make and i ll be
trying these again with less lemon

probably a silly question but the butter goes where on the blueberry mixture
or on the puff pastry prior to folding these look yummy and i will be making
them soon so i don t want to screw them up

i tried your recipethe pictures were fabulous and i loved the look of your
site however the recipe advice of missing the corn starch and sugar would
have been fine alone but the addition of lemon juice made it a gloppy mess 
fairly impossible to crumble over the top the other thing luckily was the
temperature which would have been too high for my propane driven oven thanks 
anyway i love your enthusiasm

i used this recipe as my first attempt at baking puffed pastry it was easy to
follow and turned out greatthe 20 minutes were a little long but that was
likely a factor of using an old airbake baking sheet under the parchment i
served them up for breakfast today easter morning and they were a huge
success we had a small scoop of breyer s premium creamery style 
butterscotch ripple ice cream on top it was devineoh i forgot to
mention when i pulled them out after 20 minutes they were a bit overdone
the pastry was beautiful but the blueberries were dried out but i had left
over blueberry mix so i microwaved it to cook it then spooned it on top it
worked beautifully there was one other near malfunction today this being my
second time making them ironically the first time went smoothly no over
baking no dryness nothing the blueberry mix broke through the half inch
rolled edge and began leaking onto the parchment so i took the last of the
puff pastry dough i had a little left over thankfully cut into half inch
strips moistened the one side with water and pasted it to the weak side wet
side in to patch up the leak worked like a charm i suspect it sprung a leak
because my working time was longer than expected and the cooled pastry became
room temperature i highly recommend working on a well floured surface as the
pastry dough stuck a little once it warmed up even though i dusted the
surface it wasn t as much as the first time i baked it overall great
recipe for beginners like meeasy to fix if something goes awryi haven t
tried folding them into triangles to make turn overs yet just made the round
danishs so farhttps //securegravatarcom/avatar/35567c2dd9d67e080b67ba48d32eef3a s 60 d mm r g

i made these but using sour cherries from our tree i left out the lemon juice
and cinnamon and increased the sugar 20 minutes was a bit long for my oven
they turned out amazing i m going to try adding cream cheese to the centre
next time a quick and easy dessert that will surely impress

i m not the first to do this but it s the firi m not the first to do this 
but it s the first time i ve tried it crumbled medium soft tofu as egg salad
instead of the egg i mixed it up with mayo a bit of shallot and green
onion chopped celery s p and a pinch of turmeric for a faint yellow hue
it s undetectable in terms of flavour no one had any idea it wasn t egg
don t worry it was family no allergies one said it was the best egg
salad he d ever had and it was so much faster/easier than boiling peeling
eggsps if you re looking for egg free mayo awhile ago i made a batch in my usual
way in a measuring cup with an immersion blender with a few tablespoons of
the liquid from a can of white kidney beans instead of the egg yolk along
with the lemon juice or vinegar dab of mustard oil and it worked
beautifullyhttps //wwwdinnerwithjuliecom/wp content/uploads/sb instagram

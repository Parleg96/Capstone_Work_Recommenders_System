16 unbelievably soft sour cream cookie recipes

if you aren t mixing sour cream into your cookie batter you could be missing
out on a fantastic cookie experience sour cream boasts high fat levels and a
fair amount of acidity both factors give baked goods a hefty dose of
moisture as well as a bright tangy flavor additionally sour cream does do
not thin out your batter as buttermilk or another liquid ingredient might 
which lends the baked cookies a tender fluffy texture so whether you just
need to use up some extra sour cream or want to enjoy some cookies with a
delightfully delicate crumb check out these sour cream cookie recipes and

13 great low alcoholic cocktails for day drinking

every day drinker knows the challenge of sipping when the sun s out enjoy a
couple bloody marys at 11 am and it s tough to take the rest of the day
seriously truly a boozy beverage is the bane of brunch the key to
successful day drinking then is to go low and slow choose lower alcoholic
drinks low abv cocktails and set a nice plodding pace these cocktails skip
the strong spirits instead starting with a lower alcohol base such as wine
or beer extended with non alcoholic ingredients that make the drink last
longer while they were practically designed for day drinking low alcohol
drinks are equally recommended for cocktail parties or really any time when
lucidity and dexterity are prized they ll keep you on your feet for the long
haul and of course low alcohol cocktails are also great options if you re
simply looking to cut back on your alcohol consumption without abstaining
entirely

very goodi used fresh blueberries so easy to make i would recommend that
you bake it at 375 instead of what s on the recipe i tried it at 425 but it
was browning to quickly reduced it to 375 for 18 minutes i didn t have
turbinado sugar so i sprinkled cinnamon on top after the egg wash turned out
great

used sweet almond flaky pie crust for the base which worked well the crust
was slightly sweet so the fact i didn t have turbinado sugar didn t mar the
end product and almonds cinnamon blueberriesof coursethis recipe also
came together really quickly changes i would be more generous with the
cinnamon next time which is on me additionally i had thawed my blueberries
because i thought the frozen fruit would have too much water finally the
cook time has to be reduced by 14 minutes my pies were starting to burn so i
scooted them out of the oven way early

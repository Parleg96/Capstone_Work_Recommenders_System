i used this recipe as my first attempt at baking puffed pastry it was easy to,1,2,16,0,0,4,3,0,0
follow and turned out great,0,1,5,0,0,1,1,0,0
the 20 minutes were a little long but that was,1,0,10,1,2,1,2,0,0
likely a factor of using an old airbake baking sheet under the parchment i,1,1,14,0,0,5,2,0,0
served them up for breakfast today easter morning and they were a huge,1,1,13,0,0,3,3,0,0
success we had a small scoop of breyer s premium creamery style,1,1,12,0,0,6,1,1,0
butterscotch ripple ice cream on top it was devine,0,1,9,0,0,6,1,0,0
oh i forgot to,1,0,4,0,0,1,1,0,0
mention when i pulled them out after 20 minutes they were a bit overdone,1,1,14,1,2,5,2,0,0
the pastry was beautiful but the blueberries were dried out but i had left,1,1,14,0,0,2,6,0,0
over blueberry mix so i microwaved it to cook it then spooned it on top it,1,1,16,0,0,2,3,0,0
worked beautifully there was one other near malfunction today this being my,1,1,12,0,0,2,3,0,0
second time making them ironically the first time went smoothly no over,1,1,12,0,0,2,2,0,0
baking no dryness nothing the blueberry mix broke through the half inch,1,1,12,0,0,6,2,1,0
rolled edge and began leaking onto the parchment so i took the last of the,1,1,15,0,0,2,4,0,0
puff pastry dough i had a little left over thankfully cut into half inch,1,1,14,0,0,5,2,1,0
strips moistened the one side with water and pasted it to the weak side wet,1,1,15,0,0,5,2,0,0
side in to patch up the leak worked like a charm i suspect it sprung a leak,1,1,17,0,0,5,4,0,0
because my working time was longer than expected and the cooled pastry became,1,1,13,0,0,2,3,0,0
room temperature i highly recommend working on a well floured surface as the,1,1,13,0,0,4,2,0,0
pastry dough stuck a little once it warmed up even though i dusted the,1,1,14,0,0,2,3,0,0
surface it wasn t as much as the first time i baked it overall great,1,1,15,0,0,3,2,0,0

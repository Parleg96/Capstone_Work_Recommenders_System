meyesme my sister had similar results however we found out her oven was
way to high needed a new thermostat also she had substituted homemade grape
jelly i wonder if jam freezes firms better than jellyit was a funny
disaster

disaster all was fine at first but the jam didn t firm in the freezer 
and trying to cut through frozen pastry while the jelly makes the five layers
slip around while it escapes out the sides of the pastry tower is 1 unfun and
2 messy serrated knife notwithstanding 400 is also too hot my cookies 
were black 12 mins and with all the jelly spillage even my most
successful batch were just pastry with smudges of pink what a pain/waste of
time

again we are told to preheat our ocvens at leeast 30 minutes before we will
actually use them i usually preheat an oven when removing cookies from
freezer or refrigerator and it is always heated before my cookies are ready
for the oven you should be able to freeze these unbaked for around 3 months
works for me mykele

i made these to give as gifts at christmastime for my husband s coworkers
they went over very wellmy two children even said they liked these best
over gingerbreadmen sugar cookies cinnamon sugar cookies and browniesa
nice light cookie that takes a little extra time to make but makes a big
impression

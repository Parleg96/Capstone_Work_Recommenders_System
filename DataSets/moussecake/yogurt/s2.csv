how to make blueberry greek yogurt mousse cake,2,2,8,0,0,3,2,0,0
it comes down to three steps for making this delicious blueberry greek yogurt,1,2,13,0,0,3,2,0,0
mousse cake,2,1,2,0,0,1,1,0,0
1 make the almond lemon sponge,2,2,6,1,1,3,1,0,0
start by whipping the egg whites to stiff peaks mix in the egg yolks and then,1,2,16,0,0,5,4,0,0
gently fold in the flour almond mixture so that the sponge doesn t lose the,1,1,15,0,0,5,2,0,0
volume,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0
the whipped eggs are the only thing the sponge relies on to rise and to be,1,1,16,0,0,4,4,0,0
light and spongy but still moist because of the almonds,1,1,10,0,0,3,0,0,0
the sponge is flavored with vanilla and lemon zest for extra flavor,0,1,12,0,0,4,2,0,0

the best way to get two even circles out of the sponges is to,2,2,14,0,0,2,3,0,0
draw two 18 cm 7 inch circles on the baking paper and then turn it over so that you see the circles but the batter won t touch the ink,1,2,30,1,3,6,4,1,0
put the batter into a piping bag and pipe the circles to get them extra even the ones on the picture are just poured from the bowl and evened with a spoon,2,1,32,0,0,8,7,0,0
bake the sponge on high heat for 6 minutes let cool and then cut out 17 cm,1,2,17,1,3,5,2,0,0
6 inch circles,2,1,3,1,1,2,0,1,0
usually for wet cakes like this that have a lot of filling or mousse you,1,2,15,0,0,3,2,0,0
want a light and airy sponge that can soak up all the juices from the wet,1,1,16,0,0,4,2,0,0

2 make the wild blueberry gelee,2,2,6,1,1,2,1,0,0
the blueberry gelee is made out of a wild blueberry sauce by cooking the,1,2,14,0,0,4,3,0,0
blueberries with sugar to reduce them and then mixing them with an immersion,1,1,13,0,0,3,2,0,0
blender to get a smooth consistency sauce,2,1,7,0,0,3,1,0,0
you then add the whole wild or american blueberries to the cooled sauce this,1,2,14,0,0,3,2,0,0
will give the gelee a more intense blueberry flavor as they tend to lose or,1,1,15,0,0,3,3,0,0
change the flavor after being cooked,2,1,6,0,0,2,2,0,0

this one is also very loose and melds with the other components better as,1,1,14,0,0,3,1,0,0
everything melts in your mouth,2,1,5,0,0,3,0,0,0
spread the blueberry gelee on the sponges and put in the freezer to set,2,2,14,0,0,4,3,0,0
purple spots on the mousse,1,2,5,0,0,2,0,0,0
as you may have noticed on the two different cakes here in the post one has,1,1,16,0,0,2,3,0,0
purple spots on the outside and one doesn t,1,1,9,0,0,3,0,0,0
the difference is that i froze the sponge and gelee layers completely before,1,1,13,0,0,5,2,0,0

it took about 3 4 hours to,1,0,7,1,2,1,1,0,0
freeze and then i made the mousse and continued the process of assembling,2,1,13,0,0,3,4,0,0
3 make the greek yogurt mousse,2,2,6,1,1,2,1,0,0
this greek yogurt mousse is the easiest version of a mousse to make an,1,2,14,0,0,4,2,0,0
eggless mousse,1,1,2,0,0,2,0,0,0
no creme anglaise or anything fancy just greek yogurt mousse with gelatin,1,1,12,0,0,6,0,0,0
to set it whipped cream to add air and creaminess sugar and elderflower,1,1,13,0,0,5,3,0,0
cordial if desired to sweeten,2,1,5,0,0,0,2,0,0
it is very light and gives the cake a refreshing element that goes great with,1,2,15,0,0,3,3,0,0
blueberries i urge you to use a quality greek yogurt that you love i used,1,1,15,0,0,4,5,0,0
fage as it s my favorite and also more compact than other greek yogurts,2,1,14,0,0,2,1,0,0
the elderflower cordial is just another twist to this recipe and it gives the,1,2,14,0,0,3,2,0,0
whole cake another depth of flavor please use a home made one for the best,1,1,15,0,0,5,2,0,0

adaptations for the blueberry greek yogurt mousse cake,2,2,8,0,0,4,1,0,0
this mousse cake is not really suitable to be mirror glazed because the mousse is not liquid enough to fill the sides of the cake very nice and that would show underneath the glaze you would have to make the mousse more liquid but that would also change the consistency of it,1,2,52,0,0,7,9,0,0
you can replace some of the greek yogurt with cream cheese,1,1,11,0,0,3,1,0,0
use american blueberries instead of wild blueberries in the blueberry sauce see notes in the recipe card,1,1,17,0,0,7,1,0,0

pipe the batter onto the baking sheet in two 18 cm 7 inch circles and even it out as much as possible,2,2,22,1,3,5,0,1,0
bake the sponges for about 6 7 minutes or until they are a lightly golden color and spring back when you press on it,2,2,24,1,2,4,3,0,0
leave the sponges to cool then cut out two 17 cm 6 inch circles set aside,2,2,16,1,3,3,4,1,0
blueberry gelee,2,2,2,0,0,2,0,0,0
prepare the gelatin according to the packaging instructions mine required soaking it in cold water for 5 minutes,2,2,18,1,1,5,5,0,0
put 290 g of blueberries reserving the rest for later and sugar in a pot boil on medium heat for about 10 minutes until they are reduced by half,2,2,29,1,5,10,4,1,0
remove from heat and add the lemon juice and gelatin mix everything with an immersion blender until smooth,2,2,18,0,0,7,1,0,0
now add the remaining blueberries and stir them into the blueberry gelee leave to cool to room temperature,2,2,18,0,0,5,5,0,0
distribute the blueberry gelee on the sponges half on each put them in the freezer meanwhile make the yogurt mousse,2,2,20,0,0,7,3,0,0
greek yogurt mousse,2,2,3,0,0,2,0,0,0
prepare the gelation according to the packaging instructions,2,2,8,0,0,3,2,0,0
mix the sugar and elderflower cordial if using with greek yogurt,2,2,11,0,0,2,3,0,0

place one sponge gelee side up into your 18 cm 7 inch cake ring or springform pan lined with acetate foil for a nicer finish,2,2,25,1,3,10,2,1,0
pipe half of the mousse all around and over the sponge smooth it out with an offset spatula and push some yogurt mousse higher up on the sides to minimize the air pockets,2,2,33,0,0,9,4,0,0

place the cake into the fridge overnight or for 8 hours,2,2,11,1,1,4,1,0,0
for decoration i piped some whipped cream around the top and placed some blueberries and fresh edible flowers on top i recommend decorating with lots of fresh blueberries wild or american for more flavor brush the blueberries with clear cake gel to get them shiny and keep them fresh longer,2,2,50,0,0,13,8,0,0
notes,2,2,1,0,0,1,0,0,0
if you want to go really safe about not having any purple spots on the outside of the cake first freeze the blueberry gelee on the sponge about 3 hours that will prevent it from weeping into the yogurt mousse,1,2,40,1,1,9,6,0,0
there are many ways to decorate this cake but i urge you to put lots of fresh blueberries on top which really puts the cake to another level,1,1,28,0,0,8,4,0,0
in both the mousse and glee you can use either powdered or sheet gelatin,1,1,14,0,0,4,2,0,0
be sure to use a really good quality greek yogurt that you like i used fage and it s the best also more compact than other more watery greek yogurts,1,1,30,0,0,6,5,0,0
i suggest not replacing the blueberries for the gelee sauce with american blueberries which are bigger you can however replace the whole blueberries that go into the gelee with american blueberries you will have to adapt the amount as they are bigger,1,1,42,0,0,9,8,0,0
the cake can keep for 5 days in the fridge,1,1,10,1,1,3,1,0,0
if you intend to freeze it place it in the freezer right after assembling it,2,1,15,0,0,1,4,0,0

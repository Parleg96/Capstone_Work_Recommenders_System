strawberry is in season and i am a gaga fan of the fruit i freeze them every
season make marmalade every season and relish them to the fullest

how you can freeze wash thoroughly remove the leafy part cut off the
blemish parts if any first freeze in a single layer on a baking sheet doing
so will keep them from getting stuck together later on once they re solid 
place in freezer containers or a zip lock bag you must cut the big
strawberries in halves and can freeze the small ones as full

frozen strawberries can be used to make milkshakes smoothies ice creams 
sorbet popsicles flavoured yoghurt syrup and sauce for any desserthttps //2blissofbakingcom/wp

this recipe has been chosen by many because of the flexibility and
versatility of the method do let me know if you have any queries about this
recipe for a super quick reply you can ping me on instagram 2blissofbaking

these below written points have the substitutes and the tweaking methods for
ingredients 

use of gelatine many of my readers don t use gelatine agar agar is
the closet substitute for gelatine but i personally don t like the textural
outcome of agar agar i would not use agar when making a mousse unflavoured
gelatine powder or gelatine sheets are the best choices for a good airy 
velvety smooth cream like strawberry flavoured moussehttps //2blissofbakingcom/wp

the rightful way of making a mousse is with gelatine because it helps mousse
to set and take the shape especially when making a mousse cake so it doesn t
gloop out when the cake ring is removed a mousse cake won t be possible
without gelatine but this recipe gives us the liberty as we are serving in
the bowls who says the mousse needs to be pipped out in the cups who says
the mousse needs to be firm when serving in a glass or a cup

if you don t want to use gelatine and you are planning to serve the
mousse in a glass or a bowl skip gelatine and definitely skip agar agar

this is a manipulated method of making a mousse and is approved loved by
many i think it is totally cool to alter a few things in a recipe according
to the need as long as it gives a satisfying pleasurable resulthttps //2blissofbakingcom/wp

yoghurt is one of the main ingredients in this recipe make sure to use
full fat milk yoghurt

and most importantly hang the yoghurt in a muslin cloth so the excess water
drains out if you are not using gelatine the yoghurt in the image below was
hung for an hour and i will be using a wire whisk to make it smoothhttps //2blissofbakingcom/wp 
content/uploads/2020/01/dsc 1099 edit 1 300x200jpg 

you don t need to drain out water from the yoghurt if you plan to use
gelatine it is necessary to have thick hung yoghurt if not using any
gelatine and also use a wire whisk to beat the yoghurt to smooth creamy
consistency don t use a blenderhttps //2blissofbakingcom/wp

strawberry its a strawberry yoghurt mousse so seasonal strawberries
would be the finest choice clean and chop strawberries add some sugar and
blend in a mixer this will work if you are adding gelatine to the recipe add
1/4 cup of sugar to every 1 cup of strawberry you can increase or decrease
the sugar amount depending on the sourness of the fruit

a short cut/timesaver/non seasonal/ gelatine free method is to use
strawberry preserve not jam it works wonderfully toohttps //2blissofbakingcom/wp 
content/uploads/2020/01/dsc 1096 edit 1 300x200jpg 

you do not need any sugar if using strawberry preserve whisk the yoghurt and
fruit preserve together and you are good to go



whipped cream i have used a non dairy whipping cream which is a fuss 
free product this cream has sugar already added to it and does not require
any additional sugar for whipping if you are in mumbai you will find it with
aarif

amul will not work for this recipe as we need to whip up the cream till stiff
peaks you will need a whipping cream with almost 38 fat content you can
find heavy whipping cream at any dairyhttps //2blissofbakingcom/wp 
content/uploads/2020/01/dsc 1108 1 300x200jpg 

method use a balloon whisk or an electric beater to whip cream start
at low speed and gradually increase it to medium do not whip on high
as it s very easy to over whip your cream and once that happens it
will turn into butter making it unusable

make sure to chill the cream and the bowl before you start to whip keep a big
size ice water bowl underneath the cream bowl when whisking to maintain the
cold temperature for one cup of cream add 30 gm of icing sugar make sure to
whip up the cream till stiff peaks are formed

non dairy cream is a shortcut and an escape from all the work of chilling and
maintaining the temperaturehttps //2blissofbakingcom/wp

you might think that the mousse in the images is not as vibrant as it should
be this is because i have not used any artificial colours to enhance that
look i think adding colour to food is an unnecessary addition



a quick take on mousse that is done without gelatine and is to be served in
a glass or bowl 

200 ml of full fat yoghurt hung 

40 gm of strawberry preserve

1 cup whipped cream

strawberries and microgreens to garnish

make sure not to deflate whipped cream by missing vigorously your quick fuss 
free mousse is ready and serve it in a bowl with chopped fresh strawberries
and enjoy immensely with minimum workhttps //2blissofbakingcom/wp

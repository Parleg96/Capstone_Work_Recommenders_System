how to make blueberry greek yogurt mousse cake

it comes down to three steps for making this delicious blueberry greek yogurt
mousse cake

1 make the almond lemon sponge 

start by whipping the egg whites to stiff peaks mix in the egg yolks and then
gently fold in the flour almond mixture so that the sponge doesn t lose the
volume 
the whipped eggs are the only thing the sponge relies on to rise and to be
light and spongy but still moist because of the almonds 
the sponge is flavored with vanilla and lemon zest for extra flavorfolding flour into whipped eggs data image/svg xml 3csvg 20xmlns http //wwww3org/2000/svg 20viewbox 0 200 201024 201024 3e 3c/svg 3efolding flour into whipped eggs https //prettysweetblogcom/wp content/uploads/2020/07/mixing the eggs with flour mixture 1024x1024jpgtwo circles of unbaked almond sponge on a tray data image/svg xml 3csvg 20xmlns http //wwww3org/2000/svg 20viewbox 0 200 201024 20683 3e 3c/svg 3etwo circles of unbaked almond sponge on a tray https //prettysweetblogcom/wp content/uploads/2020/07/almond sponge 1024x683jpgtwo round baked almond sponges data image/svg xml 3csvg 20xmlns http //wwww3org/2000/svg 20viewbox 0 200 201024 20683 3e 3c/svg 3etwo round baked almond sponges https //prettysweetblogcom/wp content/uploads/2020/07/cutting almond sponge 1024x683jpg 

the best way to get two even circles out of the sponges is to 

draw two 18 cm 7 inch circles on the baking paper and then turn it over so that you see the circles but the batter won t touch the ink
put the batter into a piping bag and pipe the circles to get them extra even the ones on the picture are just poured from the bowl and evened with a spoon 

bake the sponge on high heat for 6 minutes let cool and then cut out 17 cm
6 inch circles

usually for wet cakes like this that have a lot of filling or mousse you
want a light and airy sponge that can soak up all the juices from the wet
ingredients the sponge becomes a great binder for all the elements and it s
light and flavorful

content/uploads/2020/07/blueberry yogurt mousse cake 8 683x1024jpg 

2 make the wild blueberry gelee

the blueberry gelee is made out of a wild blueberry sauce by cooking the
blueberries with sugar to reduce them and then mixing them with an immersion
blender to get a smooth consistency sauce

you then add the whole wild or american blueberries to the cooled sauce this
will give the gelee a more intense blueberry flavor as they tend to lose or
change the flavor after being cooked

if you are using the american blueberries here be sure to adapt the amount as
they are biggerblueberry gelee on two round

gelee on two round sponges https //prettysweetblogcom/wp 
content/uploads/2020/07/blueberry gelee and almond 
sponge 1024x683jpg distrubute the blueberry gelee on the sponges

you will also add lemon juice to the blueberry gelee for a punch of flavor and
the gelatin to set the gelee i don t like really stiff gelees so naturally 
this one is also very loose and melds with the other components better as
everything melts in your mouth

spread the blueberry gelee on the sponges and put in the freezer to set

purple spots on the mousse 
as you may have noticed on the two different cakes here in the post one has
purple spots on the outside and one doesn t 
the difference is that i froze the sponge and gelee layers completely before
assembling the cake with the one that has no spotsit took about 3 4 hours to
freeze and then i made the mousse and continued the process of assembling

3 make the greek yogurt mousse

this greek yogurt mousse is the easiest version of a mousse to make an
eggless mousse 
no creme anglaise or anything fancy just greek yogurt mousse with gelatin 
to set it whipped cream to add air and creaminess sugar and elderflower
cordial if desired to sweeten

it is very light and gives the cake a refreshing element that goes great with
blueberries i urge you to use a quality greek yogurt that you love i used
fage as it s my favorite and also more compact than other greek yogurts

the elderflower cordial is just another twist to this recipe and it gives the
whole cake another depth of flavor please use a home made one for the best
resultssubstitute it with sugar if you wish

the blueberry greek yogurt almond and elderflower is a great combo worth
trying thougha bowl of whipped cream and a bowl of yogurt with gelatin and
sugar data image/svg xml 3csvg 20xmlns http //wwww3org/2000/svg 20viewbox 0 200 20567 20377 3e 3c/svg 3ea
bowl of whipped cream and a bowl of yogurt with gelatin and
sugar https //prettysweetblogcom/wp content/uploads/2020/07/whipped cream 
and greek yogurt 1024x683jpg softly whipped cream soft peaks on the left
and the greek yogurt mixed with sugar and gelatin on the right

you start by preparing the gelatin according to the packaging instructions 
usually blooming it in cold water if using powdered gelatin or soaking it in
cold water if using gelatin sheets 
then you mix the greek yogurt with sugar and elderflower cordial 
beat the cream to soft peaks it should just hold its shape and not be
fully whipped this way it s easier to fold it into the greek yogurt and to
pipe into the cake ring

mix the prepared gelatin with a few tablespoons of the yogurt and melt it
together add to the rest of the yogurt and mix well

now fold the cream gently into the greek yogurta bowl with mixed whipped cream and greek
yogurt data image/svg xml 3csvg 20xmlns http //wwww3org/2000/svg 20viewbox 0 200 201024 20683 3e 3c/svg 3ea
bowl with mixed whipped cream and greek
yogurt https //prettysweetblogcom/wp content/uploads/2020/07/mixing whipped 
cream and yogurt 1024x683jpg gently fold the whipped cream to the greek
yogurt

4 assemble the blueberry yogurt mousse cake

after you have all of your components for the blueberry greek yogurt mousse
cake ready begin to assemble the cake 
i love this part when all the prep work is done and all that s left to do is
stack and assemble

prepare your 18 cm 7 inch cake ring or springform pan i have an adjustable
cake ring that i place on a cake board as you can see on the picture you can
use a springform pan but a normal cake tin will not work as you will have no
way of removing the cake from the tinblueberry gelee on a sponge in a round cake

cake 1024x683jpg assembling the yogurt mousse cake

i love using an acetate foil made for lining cake rings with the purpose
of leaving the edges of the cake nice and even you can leave that out if you
don t have it but if you make cakes often i would recommend getting itplace your first sponge blueberry gelee side up in the center of the cake
ring the sponge is small enough to leave the greek yogurt mousse to be piped
around it

place the other sponge on top of the mousse and repeat the process make sure
to smooth out the top of the mousse

now put the assembled blueberry mousse cake in the fridge for 8 hours or
overnight to set

when it s ready remove it from the cake tin and decoratedata image/svg xml 3csvg 20xmlns http //wwww3org/2000/svg 20viewbox 0 200 20683 201024 3e 3c/svg 3ehttps //prettysweetblogcom/wp

5 decorating the blueberry mousse cake 

there are many different ways to decorate this cake as it s like a white clean
canvashere i show you two versions

the first one is with edible flowers like pansies and daisies with wild blueberries meringue sticks and callebaut white chocolate crispies in a circle on top there is some whipped cream underneath to give the decorations some hight 
i love how it looks but for flavor purposes i prefer the other one where i
put a lot more blueberries and that went really great with the whole cake 
i am a big believer that the dessert decorations should also serve a function
and not only be used to look pretty 

data image/svg xml 3csvg 20xmlns http //wwww3org/2000/svg 20viewbox 0 200 20683 201024 3e 3c/svg 3ehttps //prettysweetblogcom/wp 
content/uploads/2020/07/blueberry yogurt mousse cake 5 683x1024jpg 

the second one is made with a white chocolate drip whipped cream and lots of american blueberries that add another wonderful element to the mousse cake i also added some edible flowers in season like lavender flowers and chicory

which one do you preferif you make this blueberry cake i d love to see what
decorations you come up witha blueberry yogurt mousse cake with white chocolate drip and blueberries on
top data image/svg xml 3csvg 20xmlns http //wwww3org/2000/svg 20viewbox 0 200 20683 201024 3e 3c/svg 3ea

top https //prettysweetblogcom/wp content/uploads/2020/07/blueberry yogurt 
mousse cake 125 683x1024jpg 

my third option would be piling up a lot american bluebberies on top and
covering them with clear gel for topping the fruit on the cakes that way they
stay fresh longer and get a lovely shiny finish i would of course add some
fresh edible flowers also cuz they are adorablecan this mousse cake be frozenyes if you wish to freeze this cake for up to 3 months place it in the
freezer right after assembling 
take it out of the freezer a day before serving and place it in the fridge to
thaw overnight remove the cake ring the next day and decorate it if it s
still frozen leave it at room temperature for some time

data image/svg xml 3csvg 20xmlns http //wwww3org/2000/svg 20viewbox 0 200 20683 201024 3e 3c/svg 3ehttps //prettysweetblogcom/wp 
content/uploads/2020/07/blueberry yogurt mousse cake 10 683x1024jpg 

does a mousse cake have to be refrigeratedyes mousse cakes are usually made with gelatin that needs time to set 
which is done with time and cold temperature also they are usually made with
eggs that need to stay in the fridge to stay safe 
this cake has no eggs in the mousse but it still has to be refrigerated
overnight and be kept in the fridge to stay safe and fresh

how long can a mousse cake stay out of the fridgei d recommend having a mousse cake outside of the fridge for as little as
possible depends on the ingredients the structure of the cake and outside
temperature but i d suggest having it outside no more than 3 4 hours 

this one can stay in the fridge for up to 5 days

adaptations for the blueberry greek yogurt mousse cake 

this mousse cake is not really suitable to be mirror glazed because the mousse is not liquid enough to fill the sides of the cake very nice and that would show underneath the glaze you would have to make the mousse more liquid but that would also change the consistency of it
you can replace some of the greek yogurt with cream cheese 
use american blueberries instead of wild blueberries in the blueberry sauce see notes in the recipe card 
make lavender sugar and use it in the blueberry gelee to add lavender flavor to the dessert find out how to make it in this post
this cake is made in an 18 cm 7 inch cake ring it s a smaller size cake and serves about 10 people you can check this useful guide from joy of baking if you wish to make a bigger mousse cake

ingredients

almond sponge cake

2 eggs
50 g sugar
1/2 tsp vanilla extract
lemon zest of 1/2 a lemon
50 g flour
20 g almond flour

blueberry gelee

400 g wild blueberries 
50 g sugar
1 1/2 sheet gelatin or 3 g powdered gelatin
1/2 tbsp lemon juice

greek yogurt mousse

450 g greek yogurt
50 g sugar
2 tbsp elderflower syrup or sugar
9 g gelatin or 4 1/2 sheets
350 g heavy cream

metric us customary

instructions

almond sponge cake

preheat the oven to 200 c 390 degrees f and line a 40 x 30 cm 16 x 12 inches baking sheet with parchment paper

beat the egg whites with an electric mixer on medium speed until frothy then start adding the sugar tablespoon by tablespoon mix for about 3 minutes or until stiff peaks form

add the egg yolks and vanilla extract mix them in just until combined

mix together the flour almond flour lemon zest add to the eggs and gently fold in with a spatula

pipe the batter onto the baking sheet in two 18 cm 7 inch circles and even it out as much as possible

bake the sponges for about 6 7 minutes or until they are a lightly golden color and spring back when you press on it

leave the sponges to cool then cut out two 17 cm 6 inch circles set aside

blueberry gelee

prepare the gelatin according to the packaging instructions mine required soaking it in cold water for 5 minutes

put 290 g of blueberries reserving the rest for later and sugar in a pot boil on medium heat for about 10 minutes until they are reduced by half

remove from heat and add the lemon juice and gelatin mix everything with an immersion blender until smooth

now add the remaining blueberries and stir them into the blueberry gelee leave to cool to room temperature 

distribute the blueberry gelee on the sponges half on each put them in the freezer meanwhile make the yogurt mousse

greek yogurt mousse

prepare the gelation according to the packaging instructions

mix the sugar and elderflower cordial if using with greek yogurt

beat the cream to soft peaks just slightly holding its shape 

melt the prepared gelatin with two tablespoons of the greek yogurt don t boil 

mix the melted gelatin into the greek yogurt then add the whipped cream and fold it in with a spatula

put the yogurt mousse into a piping bag

assemble

place one sponge gelee side up into your 18 cm 7 inch cake ring or springform pan lined with acetate foil for a nicer finish 

pipe half of the mousse all around and over the sponge smooth it out with an offset spatula and push some yogurt mousse higher up on the sides to minimize the air pockets 

place the second sponge on top gelee side up

pipe the other half of the mousse around and on top of the sponge smooth with an offset spatula

place the cake into the fridge overnight or for 8 hours

for decoration i piped some whipped cream around the top and placed some blueberries and fresh edible flowers on top i recommend decorating with lots of fresh blueberries wild or american for more flavor brush the blueberries with clear cake gel to get them shiny and keep them fresh longer 

notes

if you want to go really safe about not having any purple spots on the outside of the cake first freeze the blueberry gelee on the sponge about 3 hours that will prevent it from weeping into the yogurt mousse
there are many ways to decorate this cake but i urge you to put lots of fresh blueberries on top which really puts the cake to another level
in both the mousse and glee you can use either powdered or sheet gelatin
be sure to use a really good quality greek yogurt that you like i used fage and it s the best also more compact than other more watery greek yogurts
i suggest not replacing the blueberries for the gelee sauce with american blueberries which are bigger you can however replace the whole blueberries that go into the gelee with american blueberries you will have to adapt the amount as they are bigger 
the cake can keep for 5 days in the fridge 
if you intend to freeze it place it in the freezer right after assembling it

hmm i can t recommend it as i haven t tried it the sponge will definitely
have a different texture but that doesn t have to be a problem also you
would have to be careful about the quantity of the flour as coconut flour
absorbs more liquid than normal flour refer to the process photos of the
sponge in the post to determine the texture it would be cool to try it but i
can t be sure of the success sorryplease report back if you decide to try
it i would love to know how it wentreply

the rightful way of making a mousse is with gelatine because it helps mousse,1,2,14,0,0,3,4,0,0
to set and take the shape especially when making a mousse cake so it doesn t,1,1,16,0,0,3,4,0,0

yoghurt is one of the main ingredients in this recipe make sure to use,1,2,14,0,0,4,2,0,0
full fat milk yoghurt,2,1,4,0,0,3,0,0,0
and most importantly hang the yoghurt in a muslin cloth so the excess water,1,2,14,0,0,4,1,0,0

fruit preserve together and you are good to go,4,1,9,0,0,2,2,0,0

at low speed and gradually increase it to medium do not whip on high,1,1,14,0,0,1,4,1,0
as it s very easy to over whip your cream and once that happens it,1,1,15,0,0,1,3,0,0
will turn into butter making it unusable,2,1,7,0,0,1,2,0,0
make sure to chill the cream and the bowl before you start to whip keep a big,1,2,17,0,0,2,5,0,0

cooking

combine the egg whites together with sugar add it gradually then whip the mixture until you get a stiff meringue consistency
start adding the egg yolks one by one without stopping whipping once all of them have been added your mixture should become very fluffy yet stable in consistency
combine the flour and the starch and then add it to the mixture in 2 3 passes pour in the then fold it into the egg mixture without mixing just move your spatula in one direction as if tucking the ingredients into each other do the same with the rest of the dry mixture
always remember to check the bottom and the middle of your cake mixture these are the places where flour gathers the mostbake the sponge at 180c 356f until done 
while baking the cake should still remain quite light in color without going golden brown

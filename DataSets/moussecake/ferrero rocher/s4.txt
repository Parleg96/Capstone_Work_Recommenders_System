ingredients

for the cake 

6 eggs 
1/2 cup 100g sugar 
180g 6oz ground hazelnuts
3 tablespoons 25g flour 
3 tablespoons 22g cocoa powder
2 teaspoons baking powder

1/2 cup 120ml water

also 

40g crushed wafers
8 ferrero rocher candies 
100g 35oz chopped hazelnuts

directions

1 preheat oven to 350f 175c line three 8 inch 20cm round pans with
parchment paper and grease with butter

2 place the hazelnuts in a food processor and process until finely ground

3 in one bowl sift flour cocoa powder baking powder stir in the ground
hazelnuts

4 in a large bowl whip eggs on high speed slowly add sugar and whip until
tripled in volume about 10 minutes

5 using a spatula gently fold the dry ingredients into the eggs in 3
additions

6 divide the batter between three pans and bake for 40 minutes until a
toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean

7 let cool for 10 minutes in the pans release from the pan and let cool
completely on cooling rack

8 make the frosting in a heatproof bowl melt the chocolate over a double
boiler or in a microwave in a 30 sec pulses and let cool to room
temperature add room temperature butter and nutella whip until fully
incorporated and fluffy

9 assemble transfer 5 6 tablespoons of the frosting to a piping bag and
keep for later place one cake layer on your serving dish spread a layer of
frosting and sprinkle with half of the crushed wafers place another layer of
cake and repeat the process spread the remaining frosting on top and side of
the cake

10 for final decoration toast the hazelnuts on a pan crush them and coat
the side of the cake pipe starts on top of the cake and place 1 ferrero
rocher on each star

11 refrigerate for 2 hours before serving

notes 

i forgot to show it in the video but to make the cake more moist before you
spread the frosting over the cake layers brush the cake with some syrup rum 
jam water or some other liquid otherwise your cake will be too dryrecipe for a simple syrup to soak the cake in a medium saucepan combine 
cup sugar and 1/2 cup water bring to a boil stirring until sugar has
dissolved allow to cool

you can make this cake with only two layers

if your oven is big enough you can bake all 3 cake pans together my over
is too small for that

for the decoration i chopped the hazelnuts coarsely but looking back i
think it is better to finely chop them

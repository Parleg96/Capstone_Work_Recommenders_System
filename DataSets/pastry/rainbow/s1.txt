here telling you that you could if i didn t think you could

so let s take this slowwww kfirst of all yeah this cake is epically tall it s about 12 tall

that does not have to be you 

and i m going to drill that into your head the entire time i talk you through
making this rainbow cake because it s true

to be 100 transparent this cake was not supposed to be 12 tall it was
going to be tall but not thisa rainbow cake on a cake stand with a slice being taken out of

here s the thing your rainbow cake is completely and totally your rainbow
cake it can be short it can be tall it can be fat it can be skinny you
know yourself you know your cake abilities and you know your audience
tasters 

you do you rainbow cake baker you ve got thisadjust this cake to your style and needs

so yes traditionally a rainbow cake would have 6 layers red orange 
yellow green blue and purple but if you just want 4 colors go for itwant 3 or 5also doable

this cake here is 6 inches wide do you want 8 incheswe can make that
happen

this cake in particular is a 6 inch cake which is how the recipe is written
i will put mega instructions in the recipe to help you scale to what you want
and need for your rainbow cake

the nice part about this cake recipe is that you have seen it so many times
beforea slice of rainbow cake on a

the base for this rainbow cake is my white layer cake which i ve turned into 

a patriotic bundt cake 
a champagne layer cake 
a funfetti bundt cake

like i said earlier this week in my gingerbread cupcakes post if it ain t
broke don t fix it

in general most cake recipes produce two 8 inch layers of cake if you
want to convert it to two 6 in layers of cake simply cut the recipe in
half 

as written mywhite layer cake makes two 8 inch layers of cake so making
a 6 layer cake means 3 batches of cake in order to make a 6
inch cake of the white layer cake recipe as written gives you
two 6 inch layers of cake which is still 3 batches of cake it s just 3
half batches 

are you followingi won t lie this is a time intensive recipe but the labor is not
intensive

yes you will need a lot of time to prepare 3 batches of cake but guess
whatmulti layer cake baking is something i m super familiar with and i m
here to share all my tips and tricks with you to make it seamless and
easy 

here are my best tips for efficiently creating 6 layers of cake

my recipe will ask you to prepare dry ingredients prepare wet ingredients 
and then combine them easy peasyin order to efficiently prepare and color 6 layers of cake do a lot of prep
up front and the rest will come more easilymise en place for making a rainbow
cake data image/svg xml 3csvg 20xmlns http //wwww3org/2000/svg 20viewbox 0 200 201200 20795 3e 3c/svg 3emise
en place for making a rainbow cake https //i0wpcom/freshaprilflourscom/wp 
content/uploads/2019/12/rainbow cake 9jpg 

1 prepare all of your dry ingredients in 3 different bowls one for each pair
of layers 
2 prepare all of your wet ingredients for each pair of layers in 3 different
bowls one for each pair of layers you now have 6 different bowls 2 for
each pair of layers a dry ingredients and a wet ingredients 
3 you ll combine wet and dry ingredients in a stand mixer or large bowl
with a handheld mixer which means that 1 of each a dry and a wet ingredient
bowl will be dirty per batch save these bowls 
4 when your batter is mixed up use these 2 dirty bowls to color your
individual layers

it s a lot of dishes but it s a rainbow so worth itan aerial photo of a slice of rainbow cake on a

aerial photo of a slice of rainbow cake on a

content/uploads/2019/12/rainbow cake 3jpg 

you ll also want to bake all of the layers of this cake a whole day in
advance because preparing ingredients for baking and cooling 6 layers 3
batches of cake took me 3 and a half hours

if you ve got the stamina go for gold in one whole day but if you d rather
practice patience and not overload yourself give yourself an additional day

it is advised that once cake layers are fully baked they should be allowed
15 20 minutes or longer if able to rest and cool in the cake pan this makes
the pans readily available for the next round of baking

i only have 2 of each size cake pan if you have more than this fantastic if
you don t no worriesyou re all set just like i was

my very very very best cake recommendation for getting layers out of the pan
easily though is my homemade cake releasea jar of homemade cake
release data image/svg xml 3csvg 20xmlns http //wwww3org/2000/svg 20viewbox 0 200 201200 201555 3e 3c/svg 3ea
jar of homemade cake release https //i1wpcom/freshaprilflourscom/wp 
content/uploads/2019/11/cake release 3jpg 

load those pans up and when you re ready to remove them from the pan they ll
come right out

just be sure you ve let them cool long enough want them to cool longer than
20 minutesgreatturn off your oven take a break and come back to the next
batch later like i said time intensive make a day out of it

once you have all of your cake layers it s time to decide how tall you want
your cake to be and this is totally simple mathpans filled with batter for a rainbow

content/uploads/2019/12/rainbow cake 7jpg 

each of my cake layers were about 2 tall all 6 layers baked pretty evenly 
so i actually didn t trim them down at all this means that 6 layers x 2
inches tall 12 inches tall

scale layers to the finished product height you want your cake to be

if you aren t comfortable decorating and serving a foot tall cake don t
make one simple as thatif you too had even cake layers and don t necessarily want to trim them but
don t want a foot tall cake cut each layer in half horizontally and make a
second cakeor freeze the layers and make another cake another time

worried about all the leftover cake scraps if you do choose just to trim themmake some cake pops or again toss the scraps in a bag freeze them and
make cake pops later

when it comes time to assemble the layers start with the color latest in the
rainbow in my case and in the written recipe s case purple work your
way up so that the earliest color in the rainbow in my case red is on
topa naked rainbow cake on a cake

feeling overwhelmed about icing it as fully and nicely as i didtotally fine

icing on the outside

served

recipe author lynn april

servings 10 servings

ingredients

cake per two 6 layers 

1 cup 120g all purpose flour be sure to measure properly
1 tablespoon 75g cornstarch 
1 cup 1 tablespoon 212g granulated sugar 
2 teaspoons baking powder 
teaspoon salt 
6 tablespoons 85g unsalted butter softened to room temperature1
cup 120ml heavy cream room temperature1 2
3 large egg whites room temperature1
1 and teaspoons vanilla extract 
food coloring in desired colors3 see notes for colors i used

whipped cream buttercream

4 cups 480g powdered sugar 
1 cup 227g unsalted butter softened to room temperature
2 teaspoons vanilla extract 
pinch of salt 
cup 80ml heavy whipping cream 

instructions

cake per two 6 layers 

place oven rack on the middle setting and preheat the oven to 350 f 177 c grease and flour or use homemade cake release two 6 round cake pans

set out two empty medium size bowls

in one medium size bowl combine the flour cornstarch sugar baking powder and salt blend ingredients together with a whisk or fork until completely combined set aside

in the other empty bowl combine the heavy cream egg whites and vanilla extract and mix gently with a fork until blended set aside 

transfer the dry ingredients to a large bowl if using a handheld mixer or the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment but do not discard the medium bowl add the room temperature butter and beat mixture on low speed until it resembles sand scrape down the sides and bottom of the bowl with a spatula and mix again on low for a few seconds until thoroughly combined 

turn the mixer speed up to medium low add half of the milk mixture about 1/2 cup to the crumb mixture and mix until blended add the remaining milk mixture to the batter and beat again on medium low until everything is incorporated turn the mixer off scrape down the sides and bottom of the bowl with a spatula and increase mixer speed to medium beat the batter for about 30 seconds until batter is smooth

divide batter evenly between the two medium size bowls that are now dirty add a bit of food coloring in the color of your choice to one of the small bowls stir and add more coloring until it is to your liking repeat with the second bowl and a second coloring i did red and orange together yellow and green together and blue and purple together 

bake cakes for about 23 25 minutes or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean remove from oven and allow cakes to cool at least 15 20 minutes preferably longer on a wire rack before removing from pans and moving on to the next batch of colors 

buttercream

in a large bowl with a handheld mixer or a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment beat the butter on medium speed until creamy about 2 minutes

with the mixer on low add in the powdered sugar vanilla and almond extracts and salt add the cream and continue to mix until everything starts to come together

increase mixer speed to high and beat for 3 4 minutes until frosting is fluffy pausing once or twice to scrape down the sides and bottom of the bowl be careful not to over beat the frosting as whipping cream may start to clump decrease mixer speed to low if you need to add more cream to thin to desired texture

assemble the cake

trim your cake layers to the desired height keeping in mind that their height x 6 layers will be the total height of your cake 

place the layer in the color you want on the bottom on a plate or cake stand using a spatula or knife spread an even layer of frosting over the entire surface place the next layer in the color you want second to last on top and press down on the top lightly continue stacking layers of cake until you reach the beginning of the rainbow and have used all of your layers spread the rest of the frosting on the cake beginning with the top and working your way down the sides decorate as desired

cake stays fresh covered at room temperature for up to 4 days cake may be covered and refrigerated for up to 7 days

notes

1 room temperature ingredients it is imperative to use room temperature ingredients in this recipe allow ingredients to sit out at room temperature at least 45 minutes before beginning
2 heavy cream i strongly encourage using cream in this recipe it keeps the crumb moist and dense and adds a creaminess to the overall texture of the cake
3 food coloring i prefer gel food coloring my favorite is americolor



recipe adapted fromwhite layer cake 

if you want this cake to be 8 in diameter double the cake recipe for each
pair of layers and do 1 and times the recipe written for the buttercream 

i used the following color names for my layers super red orange 
egg yellow leaf green royal blue and combination of violet a touch of
electric pink

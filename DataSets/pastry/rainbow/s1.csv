each pair of layers a dry ingredients and a wet ingredients,1,1,11,0,0,4,0,0,0
3 you ll combine wet and dry ingredients in a stand mixer or large bowl,1,1,15,1,1,5,1,0,0
with a handheld mixer which means that 1 of each a dry and a wet ingredient,1,1,16,1,1,3,1,0,0

you ll also want to bake all of the layers of this cake a whole day in,1,2,17,0,0,3,3,0,0
advance because preparing ingredients for baking and cooling 6 layers 3,1,1,11,1,2,4,2,0,0
batches of cake took me 3 and a half hours,2,1,10,1,1,4,1,0,0
if you ve got the stamina go for gold in one whole day but if you d rather,1,2,18,0,0,3,4,0,0
practice patience and not overload yourself give yourself an additional day,2,1,11,0,0,3,2,0,0
it is advised that once cake layers are fully baked they should be allowed,1,2,14,0,0,1,6,0,0

each of my cake layers were about 2 tall all 6 layers baked pretty evenly,1,2,15,1,2,3,2,0,0

if you aren t comfortable decorating and serving a foot tall cake don t,1,2,14,0,0,5,2,0,0
make one simple as that,0,1,5,0,0,1,1,0,0
if you too had even cake layers and don t necessarily want to trim them but,1,0,16,0,0,1,4,0,0
don t want a foot tall cake cut each layer in half horizontally and make a,1,1,16,0,0,6,3,0,0
second cake,0,1,2,0,0,1,0,0,0
or freeze the layers and make another cake another time,2,0,10,0,0,3,2,0,0
worried about all the leftover cake scraps if you do choose just to trim them,0,2,15,0,0,2,4,0,0
make some cake pops or again toss the scraps in a bag freeze them and,1,0,15,0,0,5,1,0,0

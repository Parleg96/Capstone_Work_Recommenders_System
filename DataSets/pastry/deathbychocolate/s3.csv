recipe notes,2,2,2,0,0,2,0,0,0
make sure to use room temperature ingredients firm butter will make a lumpy batter and chilled eggs will curdle the batter,1,2,21,0,0,7,5,0,0
cream the butter and sugar until light and fluffy means the sugar will be melted into the butter and the color of the butter will become pale,1,1,27,0,0,7,4,0,0
always add eggs one at a time to prevent the batter from curdling if it does curdle just add a tablespoon of flour and continue with the recipe,1,1,28,0,0,6,6,1,0
whip the sour cream and buttermilk before adding to the batter as this prevents lumps in the batter,1,1,18,0,0,5,3,0,0
to ensure you have even layers you can measure the batter using a weighing scale i like to weigh the empty pans first then make sure they are both the same weight with batter,1,1,34,0,0,7,8,0,0
bake the cakes on the center rack and do not open the oven door for the first 25 minutes of baking,1,1,21,1,2,5,4,0,0
when baked cool cakes for 5 minutes in the pan then cool completely on the cooling rack the cakes must be cooled completely before frosting otherwise the frosting will melt,1,1,30,1,1,8,5,0,0
the cake will stay fresh for up to two days at cool room temperature longer if kept in the fridge it can be frozen for a month or more,1,1,29,0,0,6,4,0,0
freezing instructions freeze the cake on a tray for an hour or two then wrap well in plastic wrap followed by a parchment paper and then aluminum foil the parchment and aluminum will prevent freezer burns and odor from other foods into the cake thaw wrapped in the fridge for 24 hours so the condensation will stay on the papers not the cake,1,1,63,1,2,21,7,0,0
other pan suggestions if you don t want to make a layer cake like this,1,1,15,0,0,3,3,0,0

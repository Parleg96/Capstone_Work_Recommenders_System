this is how you ll get super soft airy cake,1,0,10,0,0,1,4,0,0
make sure the cake has fully cooled down before assembling the buttercream will melt if you rush the process and start layering with warm cake,1,1,25,0,0,4,8,0,0
the ganache will drip best if you let it sit for 10 15 minutes after making it when it s fresh it will be too thin,1,1,26,1,4,2,6,0,0
if you store the cake in the fridge let it sit at room temperature for a good 30 minutes before serving the buttercream and ganache will harden up in the fridge and will lose their silkiness,2,1,36,1,2,9,6,0,0

how to assemble your cake like mine,2,2,7,0,0,2,1,0,0
1 let the cake cool down fully,0,2,7,1,1,1,2,0,0
this is so important it will melt the buttercream otherwise you can even let the cake cool fully in the fridge to be safe once it has reached room temperature cover it with plastic so that it doesn t dry out if you aren t going to decorate right away,1,0,50,0,0,8,11,0,0
2 remove the cakes from their pans and peel the parchment paper from the bottoms of the cake use a bread or cake knife to slice the dome off the cakes work slowly to make sure the cake stays level,1,1,40,1,1,12,7,1,0
3 you can keep this cake in two layers or four like mine no matter how many layers you end up with make sure to layer it as such place a round of cake with the smooth bottom side down and the sliced side up smooth a level layer of buttercream over the cake,1,1,54,1,1,14,3,1,0
4 if you re making two layers the top layer should be flipped upside down to the smooth uncut side is facing up to make 4 layers layer the inner pieces of cake with buttercream and finish with the bottom smooth round facing up this will ensure your cake is perfectly smooth and level,1,1,54,1,2,12,11,0,0
5 cover the entire cake with a layer of buttercream use a cake spatula or even a butter knife to smooth the buttercream as you see fit,1,1,27,1,1,10,2,0,0
6 if the ganache has hardened a bit you can microwave it for 10 second intervals stirring in between until it is warm not hot pour the ganache over the top of the cake and carefully to the edges just until you get a few drips work around the edge of the cake until you are happy with the drips,1,1,60,1,3,11,9,0,0

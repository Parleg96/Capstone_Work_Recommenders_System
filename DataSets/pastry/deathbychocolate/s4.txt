chocolate cake

instant espresso powder if you have instant coffee instead just double the amount called for to have the same strength of flavor you can replace the instant espresso and 1 cup of water in this recipe with 1 cup of brewed coffee
water make sure the water is hot enough to dissolve the instant espresso
flour i used all purpose flour but cake flour can be used instead in this case use an extra 1/4 cup of cake flour for the recipe
sugar regular granulated sugar
cocoa if you can get high quality cocoa powder black cocoa powder will give you cake and extra dark and rich look
baking powder soda i like to combine both baking powder and baking soda for the perfect texture if you want to use one i would use 1 tbsp of baking powder 
salt use more or less as per your preference
buttermilk to make your own buttermilk measure out 1 cup of regular milk minus 1 tbsp then whisk 1 tbsp white vinegar into the milk and let it sit for a few minutes until it separates use in the recipe exactly as directed
vegetable oil you can use other mild flavored oils such as canola sunflower or grapeseed melted butter will also work
eggs i used large eggs
vanilla extract or paste whatever you have handyingredients used to make chocolate buttercream and chocolate

chocolate buttercream

butter softened at room temperature if you soften it in the microwave and some of it melts let it re harden at room temperature for 10 20 minutes to ensure your buttercream turns out properly
vanilla extract or paste
icing sugar also known as powdered sugar or confectioner s sugar i don t suggest using granulated sugarit will give you a grainy consistency
cocoa just like the cake i suggest using better quality cocoa if you can
milk any type even dairy free alternatives if that s what s in your fridgethe milk is here for you to get your preferred buttercream consistency

chocolate ganache

chocolate chips or chopped up baking chocolate use any type you prefer dark/ semisweet chocolate works best for the ganache 
whipping cream if you want a lower fat option i would go as low as 18 mf table cream for making ganache

how to assemble death by chocolate cake

you can take bits and pieces from what i ve done and add your own spin or do
it completely differently if you want yours to look just like mine this is
what i did 

1 let the cake cool down fullyit will melt the buttercream otherwise you can even let the cake cool fully in the fridge to be safe once it has reached room temperature cover it with plastic so that it doesn t dry out if you aren t going to decorate right away
2 remove the cakes from their pans and peel the parchment paper from the bottoms of the cake use a bread or cake knife to slice the dome off of the cakes work slowly to make sure the cake stays level
3 you can do 2 or 4 layers no matter how many layers you end up with make sure to layer it as such place a round of cake with the smooth bottom side down and the sliced side up smooth a level layer of buttercream over the cake 
4 if you re making two layers the top layer should be flipped upside down to the smooth uncut side is facing up to make 4 layers layer the inner pieces of cake with buttercream and finish with the bottom smooth round facing up this will ensure your cake is perfectly smooth and level
5 cover the entire cake with a layer of buttercream use a cake spatula or even a butter knife to smooth the buttercream
6 pour the ganache over the top of the cake and carefully to the edges just until you get a few drips work around the edge of the cake until you are happy with the drips
7 optional i had extra buttercream so i piped it on top of the cake for decorationchocolate cake topped with buttercream and

can i make 3 layersabsolutelyin this case i would prepare 3 separate 8 cake pans the cakes
will come out thinner but you will have 3 perfect layers that won t need to
be sliced in half keep in mind the baking time may be different this will
work best if you have a convection oven as the cakes will likely be on
different racks

how do i know when my cake is done bakingtake a toothpick and insert it into the middle of each cake i like to test
both in case the heat in the oven is uneven the cakes are done when the
toothpick comes out completely clean

how do i fix broken buttercreamyes that s right buttercream can breakthis is often a temperature issue
if your butter is too cold you can let the bowl sit in a warm not hot water
bath and beat with a hand mixer until the ingredients come together if the
butter is too warm let the bowl sit in the freezer for a few minutes and
then try to mix the ingredients again 
maybe the entire batch is broken and perfectly room temperature you can try
this pro baker trick scoop some of the broken buttercream from the mixture
and microwave it just until it melts add it back to the bowl and beat until
everything comes together

what can i do with the cake domesthere s no need to waste the cake domes you slice offyou can crumble up the
domes and use them as decoration the crumbled cake can be a beautiful
decoration around the edge of the cake both on the plate and to top the cakea slice of death by chocolate cake on a plate topped with

tips for making the perfect chocolate cake

if you re going all out on an ultra chocolatey treat like this go all out and get the best quality cocoa you can findas the main source of flavor for your cake and buttercream quality cocoa will make a big difference
don t over mix your cake batter just mix until you no longer see flourthis is how you ll get super soft airy cake
make sure the cake has fully cooled down before assembling the buttercream will melt if you rush the process and start layering with warm cake
the ganache will drip best if you let it sit for 10 15 minutes after making it when it s fresh it will be too thin
if you store the cake in the fridge let it sit at room temperature for a good 30 minutes before serving the buttercream and ganache will harden up in the fridge and will lose their silkiness

how to store leftover cake with buttercream

a cake plate with a dome is the best option for storing cake the beautiful
decorations won t be mushed and the cake won t dry out you can store your
cake at room temperature for up to 3 days the cake will also last in the
fridge for about a week

if you don t have a cake plate and dome i suggest keeping the cake in the
fridge place it uncovered in the fridge for 20 30 minutes just until the
outside is hard enough that you can cover the cake with plastic without the
decoration becoming messy take the plastic off before letting the cake warm
up at room temperature to servedeath by chocolate cake with a slice cut from it on a

how to assemble your cake like mine 

1 let the cake cool down fullythis is so important it will melt the buttercream otherwise you can even let the cake cool fully in the fridge to be safe once it has reached room temperature cover it with plastic so that it doesn t dry out if you aren t going to decorate right away
2 remove the cakes from their pans and peel the parchment paper from the bottoms of the cake use a bread or cake knife to slice the dome off the cakes work slowly to make sure the cake stays level
3 you can keep this cake in two layers or four like mine no matter how many layers you end up with make sure to layer it as such place a round of cake with the smooth bottom side down and the sliced side up smooth a level layer of buttercream over the cake
4 if you re making two layers the top layer should be flipped upside down to the smooth uncut side is facing up to make 4 layers layer the inner pieces of cake with buttercream and finish with the bottom smooth round facing up this will ensure your cake is perfectly smooth and level
5 cover the entire cake with a layer of buttercream use a cake spatula or even a butter knife to smooth the buttercream as you see fit
6 if the ganache has hardened a bit you can microwave it for 10 second intervals stirring in between until it is warm not hot pour the ganache over the top of the cake and carefully to the edges just until you get a few drips work around the edge of the cake until you are happy with the drips
7 optional i had some extra buttercream so i added it to a piping bag and added some decoration on top with chocolate chips

i ve always found it weird when people call a cake death by chocolate cake
i mean it really sounds weird my aadi laughs too 
then a few years ago i did eat a chocolate cake at a restaurant that really
felt like i had died and gone to chocolate heaven

over the years i ve made many chocolate cakes and my family friends and
customers have raved about my recipes but i ve never named any death by
chocolate until this one it had the omg moment for me and i knew this is
it i finally created the ultimate chocolate cake that deserved to be called
death by chocolate if you love chocolate you must try this recipe

why make this cakehave you ever made a chocolate cake that does not look so fancy but when you dig into it it s got that omg moment this one has that 
this is a cake you make when you want to indulge in chocolate chocolate and more chocolate there are melted chocolate chocolate chips and cocoa powder in the batter and there is chocolate in the filling and frosting so you see this cake is all about chocolate and perfect for those who can never have enough chocolate 
the recipe is my butter based cake very simple and easy using the classic creaming method so no surprises there 
i am using chocolate swiss meringue buttercream between the layers and a rich chocolate ganache for the frosting and yet you can absolutely use any other chocolate buttercream if you prefer 

the process and timeline for this cake

prepare cake batter 15 minutes
bake cake 35 minutes
chill cake 4 hours at least preferably overnight 
prepare buttercream 25 minutes
crumb coat cake 15 minutes
chill cake 15 minutes

ingredients and substitutes

all purpose flour i prefer to use all purpose flour for my chocolate based cakes i believe it adds stability and prevents the cake from falling apart 
cocoa powder i always use unsweetened dutch processed cocoa powder you can find this in the regular baking aisle
buttermilk you can make buttermilk at home and it takes just five minutes here s how to make homemade buttermilk in 5 mins
sugar we are using both white and dark in this cake the dark adds that soft fudgy texture while the white does give use a nice crisp crust 
vanilla a good quality vanilla will make a huge difference in anything you make you can use vanilla extract bean paste or sugar
chocolate for buttercream the chocolate i am using for this swiss meringue buttercream is callebaut 70 cocoa ad you can see that the frosting is quite darker than regular swiss meringue but you can use 56 or moreingredients shot collage for death by chocolate

step by step instructions

cake

preheat the oven to 325 f/ 165 c/ gas mark 3
pans grease and line 3 x 7 inch round or 2 x 8 inch round baking pans with parchment paper
combine dry ingredients flour baking powder baking soda salt cocoa powder and set aside
melt chocolate in a microwave or double boiler and set aside to cool 
pro tip it is important to ensure the chocolate is cooled before
you add it to the batter 

in the bowl of a stand mixer with the paddle attachment cream butter and sugar until light and fluffy
add the eggs one at a time making sure each is well incorporated followed by the vanilla extract
next add the flour mixer along with the sour cream and buttermilk in three batches then add the melted chocolate and combine well finally add the chocolate chips and combine well 
pro tip make sure the chocolate is cooled otherwise it can seize
when added to a cold batter 

divide batter equally between the prepared baking pans 
pro tip i like to use cake strips to ensure my layer cakes bake
flat 

bake for 30 to 35 minutes or until a skewer inserted in the center comes clean
cool in the baking pan for 5 minutes invert and cool on a wire rack completely before you decorate 
pro tip it is very important that the cakes are completely cooled
before frosting otherwise the frosting will melt on the warm cakesprogress pictures collage for chocolate cake https //veenaazmanovcom/wp 
content/uploads/2019/10/death by chocolate cake progress 
pictures6jpg chocolate cake death by chocolate

chocolate swiss meringue buttercream

watch my video on how to make swiss meringue buttercream
place egg whites and sugar in the bowl of the stand mixer 
pro tip make sure the bowl is grease free otherwise the egg whites
will not whip 

using a whisk place the bowl over a double boiler and constantly whip until all the sugar has dissolved and the egg whites are fairly warm about 160 f 
pro tip you don t need a thermometer as long as all the sugar has
completely melted your eggs are ready to use 

take the bowl off the heat and whip the egg whites until you have a thick meringue with stiff peaks 
pro tip it is best to start whipping eggs at medium speed then
increase speed as you go for the best meringue 

let the mixer continue to whip on medium low until the mixer bowl feels cool to touch then gradually add butter one cube at a time with the mixer at medium speed 
pro tip it is very important that the meringue is cooled completely
before you add the butter otherwise you will have a soupy mess 

once all the butter is added whip on medium high for 2 minutes lastly add the vanilla combine well until everything is well combined
finally add the vanilla extract and melted cooled chocolate combine until you have a smooth frosting 
pro tip it is very important that the chocolate is not warm
otherwise it will seize when added to the chilled frostingprogress pictures collage for death by chocolate
cake https //veenaazmanovcom/wp content/uploads/2019/10/death by chocolate

chocolate ganache

microwave chop the chocolate into smaller similar size pieces so it melts easily pour the whipping cream over the chocolate in a microwave safe bowl heat in the microwave for a minute or more until all the chocolate is melted and smooth
stovetop alternatively you can heat the cream in a saucepan over medium heat then pour the hot cream over the chopped chocolate let stand 2 minutes combine with a spatula until it is smooth
add the butter and vanilla extract combine well cover the ganache with plastic wrap making sure to cover the surface of the chocolate to prevent any skin from forming
leave to set in the fridge for 2 hours or on the counter for 4 hours until it s about peanut butter consistency 
pro tip in summer you may need to place the ganache in the fridge to
set if it gets hard place it in the microwave for no more than 10 seconds
until you have a spreadable consistencyprogress pictures collage for death by chocolate

assemble

prepare simple syrup cool completely before using 
pro tip simple syrup is just sugar water that has been boiled and
cooled used to keep cake layers moist 

using a bread knife or cake leveler cut the domes off the cake layers brush each layer with the cooled simple syrup 
pro tip if you baked two layers you can split each layer
horizontally to make four layers 

place a cake layer on the cake board or cake stand top with a big dollop of buttercream spread evenly using a straight edge spatula
then top the second cake layer on top followed by more buttercream and the last layer continue until you have stacked all four layers
place the cake in the fridge to chill for 10 to 15 minutes 
pro tip chilling the cake at this point will ensure the layers
don t move when you frost the outside though if you leave the cake uncovered
in the fridge for too long it can dry out so 10 minutes is all you need 

next spread the ganache around and on top of the cake using a paddle motion when spreading will help smooth the ganache better 
pro tip a straight edge spatula for the top an offset
spatula and a bench scraper for the sides work better 

create a rustic finish look by simply holding the tip of the spatula horizontally against the side of the cake and rotating the cake at the same time do the same on the top of the cake
you can pipe any remaining frosting as a border or on the top of the cake i preferred to leave it like thisa frosted death by chocolate cake https //veenaazmanovcom/wp

recipe notes

make sure to use room temperature ingredients firm butter will make a lumpy batter and chilled eggs will curdle the batter 
cream the butter and sugar until light and fluffy means the sugar will be melted into the butter and the color of the butter will become pale
always add eggs one at a time to prevent the batter from curdling if it does curdle just add a tablespoon of flour and continue with the recipe 
whip the sour cream and buttermilk before adding to the batter as this prevents lumps in the batter
to ensure you have even layers you can measure the batter using a weighing scale i like to weigh the empty pans first then make sure they are both the same weight with batter 
bake the cakes on the center rack and do not open the oven door for the first 25 minutes of baking 
when baked cool cakes for 5 minutes in the pan then cool completely on the cooling rack the cakes must be cooled completely before frosting otherwise the frosting will melt 
the cake will stay fresh for up to two days at cool room temperature longer if kept in the fridge it can be frozen for a month or more
freezing instructions freeze the cake on a tray for an hour or two then wrap well in plastic wrap followed by a parchment paper and then aluminum foil the parchment and aluminum will prevent freezer burns and odor from other foods into the cake thaw wrapped in the fridge for 24 hours so the condensation will stay on the papers not the cake
other pan suggestions if you don t want to make a layer cake like this 
you can pour this batter into a 9 x 13 pan to make a classic chocolate sheet cake
pour the batter into a well greased and dusted 9 cup bundt pan for a chocolate fudge bundt cake 
this recipe can also be baked into 26 beautiful chocolate cupcakes

is there a misprint in the death by chocolate cake recipemy cake batter was
much too thick to pour/spread into the pans i added an additional cup of
liquid and it was still thick but the consistency was closer to something that
could be poured into a pan without having to use my hands to pat it out level
it s in the oven now and i am crossing my fingers that it turns out well

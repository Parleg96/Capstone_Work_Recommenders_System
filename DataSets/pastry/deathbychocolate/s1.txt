method

start by making the ganache it needs at least four hours to chill fully 
preferably overnight so it should be done ahead of time

preheat the oven and grease two 8 inch 20 cm baking tins with butter or
coconut oil set aside

add the eggs to a large mixing bowl and whisk until combined then add the
milk and olive and whisk again gently whisk the dry ingredients into the
cake mixing until no streaks of flour remain but be careful not to over mixwet ingredients being mixed in a bowl data image/svg xml 3csvg 20xmlns http //wwww3org/2000/svg 20viewbox 0 200 201200 201797 3e 3c/svg 3ewet ingredients being mixed in a bowl https //wwwbaked theblogcom/wp content/uploads/2020/10/death by chocolate cake 13jpgwet and dry ingredients being mixed together data image/svg xml 3csvg 20xmlns http //wwww3org/2000/svg 20viewbox 0 200 201200 201797 3e 3c/svg 3ewet and dry ingredients being mixed together https //wwwbaked theblogcom/wp content/uploads/2020/10/death by chocolate cake 14jpg 

pour the batter into the prepared baking tins and bake for 40 45 minutes or
until they pass the toothpick test cool the cakes fully before slicing and

make the cream cheese frosting and place it in the refrigerator until you re
ready to use it

once the cakes are fully cooled cut the domed tops off to make them about
straight don t worry if the edges are sloping in slightly cut each cake in
half lengthwise to get two layers from each cake

ice the cake in alternating layers starting with the cream cheese frosting in
the first layer then a layer of ganache followed by a third of cream cheese 
then topped with ganache place the cakes with the domes cut off cut side down
onto the frostingtwo cakes with the tops trimmed off data image/svg xml 3csvg 20xmlns http //wwww3org/2000/svg 20viewbox 0 200 201200 201797 3e 3c/svg 3etwo cakes with the tops trimmed off https //wwwbaked theblogcom/wp content/uploads/2020/10/death by chocolate cake 11jpgfirst cake layer with icing data image/svg xml 3csvg 20xmlns http //wwww3org/2000/svg 20viewbox 0 200 201200 201797 3e 3c/svg 3efirst cake layer with icing https //wwwbaked theblogcom/wp content/uploads/2020/10/death by chocolate cake 10jpgsecond cake layer with ganache data image/svg xml 3csvg 20xmlns http //wwww3org/2000/svg 20viewbox 0 200 201200 201797 3e 3c/svg 3esecond cake layer with ganache https //wwwbaked theblogcom/wp content/uploads/2020/10/death by chocolate cake 9jpgfrosting dolloped onto the third cake layer data image/svg xml 3csvg 20xmlns http //wwww3org/2000/svg 20viewbox 0 200 201200 201797 3e 3c/svg 3efrosting dolloped onto the third cake layer https //wwwbaked theblogcom/wp content/uploads/2020/10/death by chocolate cake 8jpg 

ice the sides with the remaining chocolate ganache using an offset spatula to
get the semi naked cake effect we ve done here or using the back of a spoon
to make swoops if you prefer chill the cake and drizzle the sides with melted
chocolate if desired keep it refrigerated or in a cool place until servingfinished chocolate layer cake with chocolate

tips and notes

this is a large cake but you can cut the recipe in half if you prefer a
smaller version we figured death by chocolate should be a bit over the topit might seem like a lot but it does keep quite well and can be frozen well
wrapped in an airtight container

make sure the cake layers are completely cooled before starting to ice them
if they re even a little bit warm the frosting layers will melt and the
structure will be comprimised

the cake isn t super light and fluffy because it needs to hold itself up for
four layers it s not dense but it s no angel food cake definitely a dark

substitutions

this cake is easy to make dairy free just use non dairy milk vegan cream
cheese and the ganache linked is already made with coconut milk it s adapted
from this chocolate raspberry cake so if you need a version version just use
that minus the raspberries

of course you can use any chocolate frosting or ganache recipe you like the
chocolate cream cheese frosting adds just the right amount of tang to the cake
to cut through the richness and the ganache isn t overly sweet avoid any
ultra sweet buttercream icings or it ll be too much

any light tasting oil can be used in place of olive oil vegetable canola 
whatever you have on hand don t use melted coconut oil as it ll make the cake
too densechocolate cake with chocolate drip and white chocolate

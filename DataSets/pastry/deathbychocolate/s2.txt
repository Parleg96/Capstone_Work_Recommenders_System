death by chocolate cake

when it comes to showstopping chocolate dessert recipes i love making a
chocolate mousse pie chocolate tart and this easy death by chocolate
cake

one of my favorite parts of entertaining and having friends over is to always
serve a showstopping dessert i m affectionately known as the dessert king 
and feel somewhat obliged to deliver something special everytime they come
over while i typically do brownies or blondies i wanted to go back to basics
and do a classic chocolate cake with a twist

i ve been meaning to share a death by chocolate cake recipe for quite some
time now while i already do have several chocolate cake recipes on here like
a flourless one a healthy one and even a low carb one none of
them catered to those who are obsessed with chocolate until now

a friend of mine had a birthday recently and asked if i d be okay to make a
simple chocolate cake for them knowing that they are a massive chocoholic
and vegan i agreed and opted to make them this death by chocolate cake

now this cake may look incredibly fancy but i promise you it uses simple
and easy ingredients and takes less than 30 minutes to whip up

no eggs no milk and no butter are needed but you d never tell the
texture of the cake is moist fluffy and with a tender crumb flavor
wise it is loaded with chocolate flavor in every single bite

when my friend served it at her birthday people thought i had bought it from
a cake shopeven better no one knew that it was dairy freedouble chocolate

ingredients to make a double chocolate cake

here are the ingredients you ll need to make this chocolate lovers cake i
typically use milk or plant based milk for the liquid but found using water to
be perfectly finetry not to substitute out any of the ingredients unless
specifically statedingredients to make death by

to make death by chocolate https //thebigmansworldcom/wp 
content/uploads/2020/11/death by chocolate cake ingredientsjpg 

all purpose flour plain flour that has been sifted if you d like to make this a gluten free cake use gluten free baking flour gluten free flour with added xanthan gum 
dark cocoa powder a rich and more potent cocoa powder that is almost black in color this intensifies the chocolate flavor if you don t have dark cocoa powder you can just double the amount of cocoa powder 
cocoa powder use a good quality brand and ensure it is unsweetened 
baking soda works with the vinegar to give the cake some fluffiness and rise it also omits the need for any eggs whatsoever 
espresso powder optional but intensifies the chocolate flavor 
granulated sweetener of choice white sugar brown sugar or any granulated sweetener can be used i prefer brown sugar as it yields an even more moist cake
vinegar either white vinegar or apple cider vinegar can be used 
vanilla extract a must for any good cake or baked good

oil use a neutral flavored oil like canola oil vegetable oil or refined coconut oil 
water to mix everything togetherchocolate frosting takes the chocolate up a notchuse either a healthy chocolate frosting pictured or a keto chocolate frosting 

how do you make death by chocolate cakestart by mixing your dry ingredients in a large mixing bowl once combined 
you ll then add the rest of the ingredients and mix well until a smooth
batter remains transfer the batter into two greased 8 inch cake pan and bake
for around 25 minutes or until a skewer comes out mostly clean

allow the cakes to cool completely before carefully slicing each cake in
half until 4 thin cakes remain layer the cake by adding frosting between
each layer before covering the top with it refrigerate the cake for 30
minutes to firm up before servingdeath by

tips to make the best recipe

do not overbake the cake as it continues to cook as it is cooling down once a skewer comes out mostly clean the cake is readyif you use gluten free flour you must use one that contains xanthan gum otherwise your cake will turn out gummy 
be very careful when slicing the cake in half if you d prefer a single layer cake you can skip the slicing step 
for an even more chocolate flavor feel free to fold through some chocolate chips into the batter 1/2 1 cup and bake for a further 5 minutes 
serve this cake with a scoop of chocolate ice cream or vanilla ice cream for the ultimate decadent dessert 

storing and freezing the cake

to store if you intend to eat the cake within 3 days you can store it at room temperature covered if you d like it to keep longer you can store it in the refrigerator for up to 2 weeks 
to freeze place slices of the cake into a freezer friendly container and store in the freezer for up to 6 months thaw completely before enjoying itchocolate lovers

for my dad s 50th and he said it was better than any store brought cake he
had i also infused the cake with a chocolate rum syrup and substituted the
vanilla in the frosting with some rum too i ended up eating most of the
leftovers because my family can t afford to consume that much sugar too good

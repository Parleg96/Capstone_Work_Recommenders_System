rasmalai recipe in hindi 

rasmalai recipe in gujarati 

ingredients for malai pattie chhena pattie 
1 liter milk 
2 tablespoons lemon juice 
1 cups sugar 
4 cups water 
for rabri 
1 liter milk 
3 tablespoons sugar 
1 teaspoon corn flour corn starch optional 
10 12 saffron strands kesar optional 
1/4 teaspoon green cardamom powder 
2 3 tablespoons chopped pistachio 
how to make instant rasmalai easy recipe 

to make it in shortest possible time we need to use readymade rasgullas and
condensed milk to make rabri

1 take readymade rasgullas and drain excess liquid by pressing each ball gently between two flat spatulas or spoon
2 make rabri by cooking 1/2 cup condensed milk 2 cups milk and 10 12 saffron strands until thick and creamy
3 add drained rasgullas and 2 tablespoons chopped pistachio in cooked rabri and cook for 5 minutes instant rasmalai is ready

directions 

1step 1 https //cdn3foodvivacom/wp content/themes/foodie pro/images/blankgif 

make fresh paneer chhena using 1 liter milk and 2 tablespoons lemon juice
take a clean muslin cloth or cheesecloth and tie chhena in it squeeze it
gently to remove excess water and hang it over the hook or tap for around
30 45 minutes to drain the excess water see detailed steps 1 to 5 with
photos in this recipe of chhena

2step 2 https //cdn3foodvivacom/wp content/themes/foodie pro/images/blankgif 

after about 30 minutes untie the muslin cloth and transfer chhena to a plate

3step 3 https //cdn3foodvivacom/wp content/themes/foodie pro/images/blankgif 

crumble the chhena with hand it should be crumbly yet little moist if it
has too much moisture rasmalai may break while cooking to remove excess
moisture press chenna gently between paper napkins 

4step 4 https //cdn3foodvivacom/wp content/themes/foodie pro/images/blankgif 

mash and knead crumbled chhena with hand until it comes together and turns
into dough stop kneading when your palm starts to turn greasy it will take
around 5 8 minutes depending on the quality and quantity of chhena prepared
from milk

5step 5 https //cdn3foodvivacom/wp content/themes/foodie pro/images/blankgif 

divide it into 12 equal portions make a small ball from each portion press
it gently between your palms to flatten it and turn into round pattie as shown
it the photo pattie should be thick do not press it too much otherwise it
may turn thin from sides and it will break from sides while cooking

6step 6 https //cdn3foodvivacom/wp content/themes/foodie pro/images/blankgif 

take 4 cups water and 1 cups sugar in a deep pan or in a pressure cooker and
start to heat over medium flame stir water with spatula to dissolve the sugar
completely when it comes to rolling boil gently slide all patties one piece
at a time from the side

7step 7 https //cdn3foodvivacom/wp content/themes/foodie pro/images/blankgif 

cover pan with a lid if using pressure cooker remove whistle and rubber ring
from the lid and then cover it and boil for 5 minutes over medium flame
after about 5 minutes open the lid and flip each pattie gently with a
spatula

8step 8 https //cdn3foodvivacom/wp content/themes/foodie pro/images/blankgif 

again cover with a lid and cook for 7 minutes turn off the flame and remove
the lid as you can see size of the pattie increases to almost double after
cooking in sugar syrup this is due to chhena absorbing the sugar syrup

9step 9 https //cdn3foodvivacom/wp content/themes/foodie pro/images/blankgif 

transfer it gently to a large bowl and let it cool to room temperature for 1 2
hours after that drain each pattie and press gently between two spoons to
remove excess sugar syrup be gentle while doing this process as it may break
if you apply too much pressure

10step 10 https //cdn3foodvivacom/wp content/themes/foodie pro/images/blankgif 

lets start to make rabri pour 1 liter milk in a heavy based pan thick
bottomed pan and heat it over medium flame when it comes to rolling boil 
reduce flame to low and add saffron strands

11step 11 https //cdn3foodvivacom/wp content/themes/foodie pro/images/blankgif 

stir at regular intervals in between to prevent sticking and cook until its
quantity reduces to half it will take around 15 minutes you can also cook it
over medium flame to speed up the process but make sure that milk doesn t burn
and stick at the bottom of the pan stir frequently to prevent it from
burning mix 1 teaspoon of corn flour with 1 tablespoon water and make sure
that it doesn t have any lumps add 3 tablespoons sugar corn flour water
mixture and 1/4 teaspoon cardamom powder

12step 12 https //cdn3foodvivacom/wp content/themes/foodie pro/images/blankgif 

increase flame to medium stir continuously and cook for around 3 4 minutes
until sugar dissolves add drained patties and chopped pistachio

13step 13 https //cdn3foodvivacom/wp content/themes/foodie pro/images/blankgif 

cook for 4 5 minutes this helps pattie absorb the milk and get the flavor
from inside as well

14step 14 https //cdn3foodvivacom/wp content/themes/foodie pro/images/blankgif 

turn off the flame and transfer it to serving bowl let it cool to room
temperature and then place it in refrigerator for at least 2 3 hours serve
chilled ras malai as a dessert

tips and variations 

if possible use cow s milk to make rasmalai pattie as it will softer texture
chhena should have right moisture consistency little moist and not dry to make perfect pattie
you can add crumbled paneer or mawa to thicken the rabri as well as to get authentic chunky texture
add dry fruits of your choice like sliced almonds cashew nuts etc for variation

taste sweet

serving ideas serve rasmalai as a sweet dish along with meal or as a dessert
after dinner

very nicely explained i tried for first time and the taste was good but my
paneer patties broke only 4 were good others got dissolved what could be the
reasonresponse thank you zeeshan for trying the recipe it happens if the
chenna is too wet excess moisture

i love rasmalai but my patties were hard i don t know why it was like this
and the rabri goes on consistent so plz help me out 

response thank you mr khera for trying the recipe the main reason
behind hard rasmalai is the dry chenna if the chenna has not enough moisture 
the rasmalai will turn hard

kind of can you tell me the reason why patties are flabby instead of spongeyresponse hi ankita it happens if the chhena has excess moisture or they
are not cooked enough when you try next time if it looks like chenna has too
much moisture press it between papaer napkin to get rid of excess moisture

i originally posted this recipe to another site in 2009 the name and
inspiration for this recipe came from a wonderful lady on another site who
wanted to remain namelessshe will also remain nameless here if you like
almonds as much as i do you really are going to enjoy this cookieif you are
using whole almonds chop them before measuring also if you like a cookie that
has a sweet/salty thing going on use the roasted and salted almonds to
flatten the cookies use the flat bottom of a glass dipped in sugarthe way
that this recipe is written gives me 32 cookies depending on how big you make
yours you might get more or less the time for each cookie sheet is the time
for baking please let cookies cool on cookie sheet for 2 to 3 minutes before
removing let finish cooling on wire racksservings are for 2 cookies each
and thanks again to my secret chef you know who you are posted to

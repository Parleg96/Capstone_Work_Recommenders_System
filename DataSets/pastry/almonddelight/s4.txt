1 litre milk
1/2 cup condensed milk
1 cup almonds
1 teaspoon powdered green cardamom

1 cup fresh cream
1 teaspoon corn flour
1 pinch saffron
2 cup ice cubes

how to make roasted almond ice cream

step 1 boil milk

take a heavy bottomed pan and add milk to it then heat it on low flame and
let the milk boil keep stirring once in a while or the milk will start
sticking to the bottom of the pan and will eventually begin to burn spoiling
the taste of the milk

step 2 dry roast the almonds

once the milk is reduced to half its original quantity and acquires a thick 
pinkish texture switch off the gas and allow it to cool meanwhile dry roast
the almonds till they acquire a nutty aroma now roughly powder the almonds
and keep some to be used as garnish later

step 3 add cardamom powder

now switch on the gas again and add the condensed milk almonds and cream
once it comes to a boil add cardamom powder powder it with a rolling pin at
that very moment as freshly powdered cardamom has a superior aroma saffron
dissolved in a spoon of milk and cornflour dissolved in half a cup cold milk
allow the milk to simmer for 2 5 minutes

step 4 refrigerator the ice cream

now let it cool by placing the vessel in a bowl of ice this will make it more
creamy as soon as the milk cools down refrigerate it for two to three hours
once the ice cream is set remove it from the refrigerator and mix it well
with a hand blender this step is important to ensure that your ice cream
turns out to be creamy

step 5 garnish and relish

pour it in the mold of your choice and freeze the ice cream will be ready in
two to three hours add chopped almonds on top you can also decorate the ice 
cream with pistachios raisins and wafers or mint and sprinklers serve it as
a post dinner dessert your kids are going to love it

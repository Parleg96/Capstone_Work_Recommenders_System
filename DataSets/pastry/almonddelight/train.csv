don t forget vanilla i know in chocolate recipes the main focus is the chocolate ingredients like oreos cocoa powder or chocolate chips but a good vanilla extract is absolutely essential to deepening the flavor of these homemade oreo brownies,1.0,0.0,40.0,0.0,0.0,18.0,5.0,0.0,0
don t over bake the brownies chocolate desserts are tricky to bake perfectly because you can t go by sight when you re making a chocolate chip cookie or a vanilla cupcake you can see the baked goods turning a golden brown but with brownies there s a fine line between baked and burnt take out the brownies when a knife inserted near the edge comes out clean but a knife inserted into the middle comes out a little gooey the brownies will continue to cook as they cool and you ll be left with that perfect gooey center and a crisp crunchy edge,0.0,1.0,104.0,0.0,0.0,25.0,23.0,1.0,0

ingredients for oreo fudge brownies,2.0,2.0,5.0,0.0,0.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,0
butter i always suggest using unsalted butter but salted will work in a pinch simply omit the salt called for in the recipe,1.0,2.0,23.0,0.0,0.0,6.0,6.0,1.0,0
sugar granulated sugar works best for these brownies if you only have brown sugar and are dying to bake these it will work but because brown sugar contains more moisture than granulated the brownies will be slightly more cakey,1.0,1.0,39.0,0.0,0.0,8.0,10.0,0.0,0
oil liquified coconut oil vegetable oil and canola oil are all great options i don t suggest olive oil because it will add an aftertaste i don t find particularly desirable at least not in brownies,0.0,1.0,36.0,0.0,0.0,11.0,8.0,0.0,0
vanilla extract just a dash enhances all of the flavors if you re out don t fret,0.0,0.0,17.0,0.0,0.0,6.0,1.0,0.0,0
you can simply omit this ingredient and bake as directed,1.0,0.0,10.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,0.0,0
eggs make sure you have large eggs not medium or extra large and bring them to room temperature before you begin baking,0.0,1.0,22.0,0.0,0.0,4.0,7.0,1.0,0
flour all purpose flour measured the right way,0.0,0.0,8.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,2.0,0.0,0
which is by fluffing the flour up in the bag then lightly spooning the flour into the measuring cup fill the cup up until it s heaping over then use the flat edge of a knife to level it off measure your cocoa powder the same way,0.0,0.0,47.0,0.0,0.0,9.0,10.0,1.0,0
or use an electric scale,0.0,0.0,5.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0
cocoa powder because this recipe doesn t call for baking soda or baking powder you can use dutch process cocoa powder or unsweetened cocoa powder i prefer dutch process because it gives the brownies a rich cocoa flavor and color,0.0,0.0,40.0,0.0,0.0,17.0,7.0,0.0,0
salt don t skip the salt,0.0,0.0,6.0,0.0,0.0,4.0,1.0,0.0,0
just a dash balances out the sweetness and enhances the chocolate flavor,0.0,0.0,12.0,0.0,0.0,4.0,2.0,0.0,0
oreo cookies you ll need 14 oreo cookies for this recipe,0.0,0.0,11.0,1.0,2.0,4.0,2.0,0.0,0
i like to just roughly break them up with my hands you ll fold half into the batter and then press the other half on top of the brownie batter,1.0,0.0,30.0,0.0,0.0,8.0,4.0,0.0,0
chocolate chips i like to add between a 1/2 cup to 1 cup you can use any variety of chocolate chips but i prefer semi sweet or dark chocolate note using white chocolate chips or milk chocolate chips will make these brownies much sweeter you can omit the chocolate chips all together but the tops of the brownies may be a little less shiny,2.0,1.0,64.0,1.0,3.0,19.0,8.0,1.0,0

tips for baking perfect brownies,2.0,2.0,5.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,0.0,0
1 use the right baking pan,0.0,2.0,6.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,0.0,0
i suggest using a reflective metal baking pan like this one,1.0,0.0,11.0,0.0,0.0,4.0,3.0,0.0,0
2 if you re using a glass or ceramic baking pan you ll need to increase the bake time by about 10 minutes,1.0,1.0,23.0,1.0,3.0,5.0,5.0,0.0,0
3 be sure your eggs are a room temperature,0.0,1.0,9.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,0.0,0
this will ensure your ingredients properly bond together and that your eggs don t scramble when they re combined with the hot butter,1.0,0.0,23.0,0.0,0.0,5.0,4.0,0.0,0
4 don t over mix your brownie batter,0.0,1.0,8.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,0
this is what causes cakey brownies,1.0,0.0,6.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,2.0,0.0,0
5 pro tip stop mixing when you still see the tiniest trace of dry ingredients then fold in your chocolate chips and oreo cookies you should only need 3 or 4 stirs to incorporate those final ingredients it s better to under mix than over mix,0.0,1.0,46.0,1.0,3.0,11.0,5.0,0.0,0
6 bake your brownies on the middle rack i get a lot of questions about this so just wanted to point out that unless otherwise stated i always suggest baking on the middle rack,1.0,0.0,34.0,1.0,1.0,7.0,7.0,0.0,0
7 you ll also want to be sure not to over bake your oreo brownies,0.0,1.0,15.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,4.0,0.0,0
they should still be a little jiggly in the center and a few moist crumbs will come out when a toothpick is inserted,1.0,0.0,23.0,0.0,0.0,5.0,4.0,0.0,0
8 place your brownies on a cooling rack and cool completely in the pan,0.0,1.0,14.0,1.0,1.0,6.0,0.0,0.0,0
you ll be amazed at how much they firm up as they cool,1.0,0.0,13.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,5.0,0.0,0
9 if you want a warm and gooey brownie simply reheat in the microwave for a few seconds,0.0,1.0,18.0,1.0,1.0,5.0,2.0,0.0,0

can you make brownies with hot chocolate mix,2.0,2.0,8.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,1.0,0.0,0
yes technically you can make brownies using hot chocolate mix however hot,1.0,2.0,12.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,2.0,0.0,0
chocolate or hot cocoa mix contains added sugar and sometimes artificial,1.0,1.0,11.0,0.0,0.0,4.0,2.0,0.0,0
flavors and preservatives to keep this recipe more wholesome i chose to use,1.0,1.0,13.0,0.0,0.0,4.0,3.0,0.0,0
unsweetened cocoa powder instead if you do choose to use hot chocolate mix,1.0,1.0,13.0,0.0,0.0,4.0,3.0,0.0,0
decrease the amount of sugar by 1/4 cup for this recipe,2.0,1.0,11.0,1.0,2.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,0

i particularly enjoyed that this wonderfully chocolate cake was not too heavy,1.0,1.0,12.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,2.0,0.0,0
like another reviewer mentioned i recommend letting your cream warm to room,1.0,1.0,12.0,0.0,0.0,4.0,3.0,0.0,0
temperature before adding it to the chocolate or simply heat it in the,1.0,1.0,13.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,2.0,0.0,0

didn t have any problem with letting the filling chill completely before,1.0,1.0,12.0,0.0,0.0,5.0,2.0,0.0,0
spreading it as some reviewers mentioned also be aware that if you make the,1.0,1.0,14.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,4.0,0.0,0
frosting as written not with cool whip it won t be sweet just,1.0,1.0,13.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,4.0,0.0,0

pretty okay it s a dense brownie like batter but salvageable with some water,1.0,2.0,14.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,2.0,0.0,0
coffee or maybe even some coca cola i made the recipe exactly as described,1.0,1.0,14.0,0.0,0.0,6.0,1.0,0.0,0
and didn t read reviews until i had already started but figured hey maybe,1.0,1.0,14.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,4.0,0.0,0
they miss read something or miss measured i was wrong however and the,1.0,1.0,13.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,4.0,0.0,0
batter turned out to be very thick like a brownie batter however i salvaged,1.0,1.0,14.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,3.0,0.0,0
my cupcakes by adding about 1/2 cup of water then about 1/8 cup of coffee,1.0,1.0,15.0,1.0,4.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,0
next time i would probably thin it out with all coffee or all water this,1.0,1.0,15.0,0.0,0.0,4.0,1.0,0.0,0
totally saved them even though they were still a little dense but very good,1.0,1.0,14.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,2.0,0.0,0
the cupcakes rose very well i set my timer for 15 min but they needed an,1.0,1.0,16.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,0
additional 5 min ps i added the coffee after the batter was already,1.0,1.0,13.0,1.0,1.0,5.0,2.0,0.0,0
complete and it worked fine so i would make the batter first and adjust coffee,1.0,1.0,15.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,2.0,0.0,0

how to make moist chocolate cupcakes,2.0,2.0,6.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,0
1 this recipe calls for vegetable oil instead of melted butter i went back and forth on this for a bit and wound up choosing the oil because it creates an ultra moist texture and open slightly spongy crumb which is perfect for chocolate cupcakes for more details on how these two fats affect tenderness flavor and texture check out my butter vs oil in baking article,1.0,2.0,67.0,1.0,1.0,22.0,8.0,1.0,0
2 since oil is liquid at room temperature it gives a better sensation of moistness than butter does,1.0,1.0,18.0,1.0,1.0,6.0,4.0,0.0,0
3 be sure to also use full fat ingredients and don t reduce the sugar in this recipe sugar actually helps contribute to moistness if you can believe it,0.0,1.0,29.0,1.0,1.0,6.0,8.0,0.0,0
4 lastly be sure not to accidentally over measure your flour and cocoa powder spoon both ingredients into their measuring cups then level off the excess with a knife or better yet use a digital kitchen scale check out my how to measure flour article for a step by step on how to accurately measure your dry ingredients,0.0,0.0,58.0,1.0,1.0,16.0,5.0,1.0,0

hot water and espresso powder in chocolate cupcakes,2.0,2.0,8.0,0.0,0.0,5.0,0.0,1.0,0
if you bake chocolate cake or cupcakes a lot you ve probably seen quite a few,1.0,2.0,16.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,4.0,1.0,0
recipes that utilize hot water or even hot coffee it helps to dissolve and,1.0,1.0,14.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,3.0,0.0,0
bloom the cocoa powder to bring out as much flavor with as few cocoa lumps,1.0,1.0,15.0,0.0,0.0,6.0,1.0,0.0,0
as possible in my best chocolate cupcake recipe i use a combination of hot,1.0,1.0,14.0,0.0,0.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,0
water and instant espresso powder the espresso simply enhances the chocolate,1.0,1.0,11.0,0.0,0.0,4.0,2.0,0.0,0
flavor without actually being perceptible,2.0,1.0,5.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0
do i have to use espresso powder,0.0,2.0,7.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,3.0,0.0,0
alternatively you could use hot coffee for the same effect or you can omit,1.0,0.0,14.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,2.0,0.0,0
it altogether if you d prefer,2.0,1.0,6.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,0
sugar s,2.0,2.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,0
most of my initial recipe tests used only granulated sugar for the cupcakes,1.0,2.0,13.0,0.0,0.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,0
then i thought i d try to add in a bit of brown sugar the resulting,1.0,1.0,16.0,0.0,0.0,5.0,4.0,0.0,0
chocolate cupcakes were flavorful moist and slightly chewy perfect,0.0,1.0,9.0,0.0,0.0,4.0,2.0,1.0,0
eggs,2.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0
the more whole eggs a cake recipe has the richer it ll be i repeated one of,1.0,2.0,17.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,4.0,0.0,0
my favorite baking tricks and added in an egg yolk it works beautifully for,1.0,1.0,14.0,0.0,0.0,4.0,2.0,0.0,0
brownies and cookies so why not chocolate cupcakes,0.0,1.0,8.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,0
it adds more richness,1.0,0.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0

is there an egg substitute for chocolate cupcakes,0.0,2.0,8.0,0.0,0.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,0
i have yet to find an amazing egg substitute for this recipe my friend gemma,1.0,0.0,15.0,0.0,0.0,5.0,2.0,0.0,0
from bigger bolder baking has an excellent resource on egg substitutes,2.0,1.0,11.0,0.0,0.0,5.0,1.0,0.0,0
leavener,2.0,2.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0
oh man this is where i encountered the most frustration i went back and,1.0,2.0,14.0,0.0,0.0,4.0,3.0,0.0,0
forth on this when i used both baking soda and baking powder the cupcakes,1.0,1.0,14.0,0.0,0.0,4.0,4.0,1.0,0
rose to a beautiful height while baking but then fell and collapsed slightly,1.0,1.0,13.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,4.0,0.0,0
as they cooled bummer that was too much leavener,2.0,1.0,9.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,2.0,0.0,0
i went back to only baking soda which is more effective per teaspoon than,1.0,2.0,14.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,0
baking powder but had to add vinegar to the recipe why,0.0,1.0,11.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,3.0,0.0,0
well because there,1.0,0.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0
wasn t much acid for the baking soda to react with originally dutch process,1.0,1.0,14.0,0.0,0.0,5.0,1.0,0.0,0
cocoa powder has been neutralized of its acid so it was only the sour cream,1.0,1.0,15.0,0.0,0.0,4.0,4.0,0.0,0
and small amount of brown sugar for tall and light cupcakes we need enough,1.0,1.0,14.0,0.0,0.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,0
leavening so baking soda vinegar did the trick this is why you omit the,1.0,1.0,14.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,5.0,0.0,0
vinegar if you re using natural cocoa powder,2.0,1.0,8.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,2.0,0.0,0
flour,2.0,2.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0
i tried testing with bread flour after seeing a few ultimate recipes,1.0,2.0,12.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,3.0,0.0,0
elsewhere that used it but found that all purpose worked just as well since,1.0,1.0,14.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,0.0,0
all purpose flour is more readily available i stuck with that to make things,1.0,1.0,14.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,3.0,0.0,0
easiest for you,2.0,1.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0
sour cream,2.0,2.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0
i find that sour cream adds such a lovely richness and balance of flavor to,1.0,2.0,15.0,0.0,0.0,5.0,2.0,0.0,0
cupcakes so i just had to include it here i think it definitely works best,1.0,1.0,15.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,5.0,1.0,0
but full fat plain yogurt also makes a fine alternative in chocolate cupcakes,2.0,1.0,13.0,0.0,0.0,6.0,1.0,1.0,0
the chocolate buttercream frosting,2.0,2.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,0
when i originally published this recipe it used the more difficult chocolate,1.0,2.0,12.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,2.0,0.0,0
swiss meringue buttercream as the frosting although delicious it s more,1.0,1.0,11.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,1.0,0.0,0
advanced and requires more time and special equipment,2.0,1.0,8.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,0.0,0
in the interest of making this recipe easier but equally as delicious i,1.0,2.0,13.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,1.0,0.0,0
swapped in an american style chocolate buttercream that s made extra special,1.0,1.0,12.0,0.0,0.0,4.0,2.0,0.0,0
with two additions the frosting contains cooled chocolate ganache for extra,1.0,1.0,11.0,0.0,0.0,4.0,1.0,0.0,0
chocolate flavor and fudgy richness,2.0,1.0,5.0,0.0,0.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,0
for an extra smooth and rich frosting opt for organic powdered sugar and high,1.0,2.0,14.0,0.0,0.0,4.0,1.0,0.0,0
fat cocoa powder the full explanation for both is found here,2.0,1.0,11.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,2.0,0.0,0

do you happen to know how much batter is best to put in a standard sized tin,0.0,2.0,17.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,6.0,0.0,0
oftentimes with chocolate cupcakes they rise excessively and i have overflow,1.0,0.0,11.0,0.0,0.0,5.0,2.0,1.0,0
i use 1/4 c batter with cupcake recipes but your recommendation is to fill,1.0,1.0,14.0,1.0,2.0,5.0,3.0,1.0,0

prior to baking the entire batch one filled 2/3 full the other 3/4 full for,1.0,1.0,15.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,2.0,0.0,0
the designated time and see which you prefer then you re not messing up an,1.0,1.0,15.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,4.0,0.0,0

chocolate flavor possible we prefer to use semisweet but feel free to use,1.0,1.0,13.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,4.0,0.0,0
milk or bittersweet chocolate instead it s totally up to you,0.0,1.0,11.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,1.0,0.0,0
you won t need,1.0,0.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,2.0,0.0,0
to increase/reduce the amount of sugar but again use the type of chocolate,1.0,1.0,13.0,0.0,0.0,4.0,1.0,0.0,0
based on your personal preference just know that each chocolate will alter,1.0,1.0,12.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,3.0,0.0,0

i have to wait longer to even tell you what it is,2.0,1.0,12.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,4.0,0.0,0
so we were going to launch this brand new product in april but our inventory,1.0,2.0,15.0,0.0,0.0,4.0,3.0,0.0,0
got held up at the ports unexpectedly,2.0,1.0,7.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,2.0,0.0,0
we figured we d just delay the launch to may,2.0,2.0,10.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,3.0,0.0,0
then just before i left town for my 31st birthday trip at the end of march,1.0,2.0,16.0,1.0,2.0,4.0,1.0,0.0,0
we got the bad news,2.0,1.0,5.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0
the new secret product we have been working so hard on for the last year had a,1.0,2.0,17.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,4.0,0.0,0
packaging flaw,2.0,1.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,0
it took all my energy not to panic,2.0,2.0,8.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,2.0,0.0,0
you see we had conducted test shipments of the product as part of our due,1.0,2.0,15.0,0.0,0.0,4.0,3.0,0.0,0
diligence this is when we discovered a problem the packaging on the inside,1.0,1.0,13.0,0.0,0.0,4.0,2.0,0.0,0
didn t secure the products as well as it should ve resulting in the contents,1.0,1.0,15.0,0.0,0.0,4.0,3.0,0.0,0
moving around and the packaging itself becoming damaged in some cases,2.0,1.0,11.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,3.0,0.0,0
the idea of any of my beloved hth customers spending their hard earned money,1.0,2.0,14.0,0.0,0.0,4.0,2.0,0.0,0
on our new product only to open the box to see the contents haphazardly,1.0,1.0,14.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,2.0,0.0,0
shuffled around inside or damaged packaging i couldn t let that happen,2.0,1.0,12.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,4.0,0.0,0
this is when my inner perfectionist took over and we decided to postpone the,1.0,2.0,14.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,4.0,0.0,0
launch until fall so we could have time to correct the packaging issue in,1.0,1.0,14.0,0.0,0.0,5.0,2.0,0.0,0
order to give our customers the best possible experience,2.0,1.0,9.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,1.0,0.0,0
it wasn t an easy decision,2.0,2.0,6.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0
but i know it was the right decision because i wouldn t be able to sleep at,1.0,2.0,17.0,0.0,0.0,4.0,5.0,0.0,0
night without knowing we had done everything we could to do right by you guys,2.0,1.0,15.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,4.0,0.0,0
so sadly you ll have to wait until after summer to learn what this new,1.0,2.0,15.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,4.0,0.0,0
product is but trust me it ll be worth the wait,2.0,1.0,11.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,3.0,0.0,0
and a few good things have come out of this challenge we now have extra,1.0,2.0,15.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,3.0,0.0,0
time to work on another project that we ve been planning to do for a while,2.0,1.0,16.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,5.0,0.0,0

what makes best homemade fluffy cupcakes,0.0,2.0,6.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,0
that s a result of the air bubbles that you whip into the batter that end up expanding in the oven during baking however if the batter is over mixed those bubbles end up collapsing and the cupcakes don t fully rise and can sink too that s why you should only mix the cake batter until just combined,1.0,0.0,59.0,0.0,0.0,10.0,15.0,1.0,0
also measure ingredients properly because baking is science and those measurements and ingredients combine together to create the best fluffy texture,2.0,1.0,21.0,0.0,0.0,7.0,3.0,0.0,0

tips and techniques,2.0,2.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,0
all ingredients must be at room temperature because this allows them to blend together smoothly and evenly,1.0,2.0,17.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,3.0,0.0,0
only use all purpose flour don t replace all purpose flour with any other flour because it does not yield the same good results i have various other flours including whole wheat and gluten free and neither tasted great the only other flour that still yielded good results was homemade cake flour,1.0,1.0,52.0,0.0,0.0,13.0,11.0,0.0,0
don t over mix cupcake batter because that will yield very tough cupcakes and there is a higher probability of them sinking in the center during baking,1.0,1.0,27.0,0.0,0.0,7.0,4.0,1.0,0
frost cool cupcakes allow the cupcakes to fully cool down before frosting them because that prevents the frosting from melting all over the cupcakes and making a mess,1.0,1.0,28.0,0.0,0.0,7.0,6.0,1.0,0
serve a crowd recipe can easily be doubled to serve more people you will have to bake in batches though if you don t have multiple ovens,1.0,1.0,27.0,0.0,0.0,6.0,8.0,0.0,0
oil vs butter typically i am a big fan of butter but in order to make these cupcakes fluffy oil has to be used to give them an airy texture butter tends to make them very dense,1.0,1.0,37.0,0.0,0.0,11.0,10.0,1.0,0
both baking powder and baking soda are required don t replace one with the other because that will alter the texture of this cake,1.0,1.0,24.0,0.0,0.0,5.0,5.0,0.0,0
use warm brewed coffee because if it s too hot it will start cooking the eggs in the batter it cannot be boiling hot,1.0,1.0,24.0,0.0,0.0,5.0,6.0,0.0,0
don t use dark chocolate this is with regards to cocoa powder because it makes the cupcakes too bitter,1.0,1.0,19.0,0.0,0.0,7.0,3.0,1.0,0
how to make homemade buttermilk,0.0,1.0,5.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,0.0,0
i know this is not an ingredient many of us have on hand all the time but no worries make a great buttermilk substitute at home by mixing together 1 cup whole milk with 1 tbsp vinegar or lemon juice let it sit for 5 minutes mix and then use in this recipe,1.0,0.0,53.0,1.0,3.0,13.0,8.0,1.0,0
don t replace buttermilk with whole milk because buttermilk adds a lot of moisture to the cupcakes and makes it super soft,2.0,1.0,22.0,0.0,0.0,8.0,3.0,1.0,0

so let s talk a bit about these cupcake there s no need for creaming to get,1.0,2.0,17.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,4.0,1.0,0
involved which is kind of a plus creaming butter and sugar together makes,1.0,1.0,13.0,0.0,0.0,4.0,3.0,0.0,0
quite a fabulous cupcake but sometimes you just want quick and easy and to,1.0,1.0,14.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0
barely even need to use a mixer i mean basically like a box mix but not you,1.0,1.0,17.0,0.0,0.0,4.0,3.0,0.0,0
know,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0
these are those cupcakes the og cupcake was that way too but used,1.0,0.0,13.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,0
butter and were a little denser these cupcakes use oil and are lighter,2.0,1.0,13.0,0.0,0.0,4.0,3.0,1.0,0
we ve got the usual suspects in this cupcake starting with the dry,1.0,2.0,13.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,4.0,1.0,0
ingredients all purpose flour sugar baking powder and salt easy common,1.0,1.0,11.0,0.0,0.0,4.0,2.0,0.0,0
ingredients that you should totally have in your pantry already mix em all,1.0,1.0,13.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,2.0,0.0,0
together and set em aside,2.0,1.0,5.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,2.0,0.0,0
next are the wet ingredients milk vegetable oil vanilla extract and eggs,1.0,2.0,12.0,0.0,0.0,6.0,1.0,0.0,0
the oil is the fat component instead of butter and in my opinion tends to,1.0,1.0,15.0,0.0,0.0,4.0,2.0,0.0,0
make a more moist cake that stays moist for longer totally true for these,1.0,1.0,14.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,2.0,0.0,0
cupcakes the milk i typically use 2 adds to the structure of the cake in,1.0,1.0,15.0,1.0,1.0,5.0,2.0,1.0,0
addition to adding moisture milk adds fluff and i love some fluff i used a,1.0,1.0,15.0,0.0,0.0,5.0,4.0,0.0,0
full tablespoon of vanilla extract to make sure there s plenty of delicious,1.0,1.0,13.0,0.0,0.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,0
vanilla flavor then the eggs add more moisture structure and flavor i,1.0,1.0,12.0,0.0,0.0,6.0,1.0,0.0,0
switched it up in these and went with whole eggs instead of egg whites no,1.0,1.0,15.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,3.0,0.0,0
more egg yolks getting wasted here,0.0,1.0,6.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,2.0,0.0,0
once the wet and dry ingredients are combined the water is added,2.0,0.0,12.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,4.0,0.0,0
there s so much moisture in these cupcakes,0.0,2.0,8.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,0
i love them,0.0,0.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0

a vanilla bean,1.0,2.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,0
using a bean gives the cupcakes a strong vanilla flavor if you don t have a bean you can leave it it off without adjusting any other ingredients the recipe will still be amazing just not as strongly flavored,1.0,1.0,39.0,0.0,0.0,7.0,9.0,1.0,0
both butter and oil,1.0,1.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,0
cupcakes that are made with only only oil lack the flavor that butter provides using only butter they can end up being too dense and not moist enough the combination ends up giving a perfect flavor and texture,1.0,1.0,38.0,0.0,0.0,8.0,10.0,1.0,0
sour cream,1.0,1.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0

omg this is the best i cannot imagine why anyone would not like this,1.0,2.0,14.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,3.0,0.0,0
fruitcake the only thing i changed was i used only one tablespoon of,1.0,1.0,13.0,0.0,0.0,4.0,4.0,1.0,0
cloves because they can so easily be overwhelming and that seemed like a,1.0,1.0,13.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,4.0,0.0,0

i m an experienced cook but i d never previously had the foresight to make a,1.0,2.0,16.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,4.0,0.0,0
fruitcake before the season until now first discovery was that these things,1.0,1.0,12.0,0.0,0.0,4.0,1.0,0.0,0
are hellaciously expensive to make second this is a poor choice for a,1.0,1.0,13.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,3.0,0.0,0
fruitcake and i do believe the fault lies with the tempering i followed the,1.0,1.0,14.0,0.0,0.0,5.0,4.0,0.0,0
instructions thoroughly and my cake was dry it felt moist enough and i could,1.0,1.0,14.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,3.0,0.0,0
never get it to accept more than 2 tbsp of brandy but was dry upon eating,1.0,1.0,16.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,4.0,1.0,0
also 2 tbsp of cloves is such serious overkill too much cloves lastly it,1.0,1.0,14.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,0
could have been sweeter which given the ingredients might seem odd still,1.0,1.0,12.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,4.0,0.0,0
the sweet factor was minimal research after the fact has shown me that the,1.0,1.0,14.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,3.0,0.0,0
cakes need to be wrapped in a brandy soaked cloth and placed in an airtight,1.0,1.0,15.0,0.0,0.0,4.0,5.0,0.0,0

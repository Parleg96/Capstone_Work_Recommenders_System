16 unbelievably soft sour cream cookie recipes

if you aren t mixing sour cream into your cookie batter you could be missing
out on a fantastic cookie experience sour cream boasts high fat levels and a
fair amount of acidity both factors give baked goods a hefty dose of
moisture as well as a bright tangy flavor additionally sour cream does do
not thin out your batter as buttermilk or another liquid ingredient might 
which lends the baked cookies a tender fluffy texture so whether you just
need to use up some extra sour cream or want to enjoy some cookies with a
delightfully delicate crumb check out these sour cream cookie recipes and

13 great low alcoholic cocktails for day drinking

every day drinker knows the challenge of sipping when the sun s out enjoy a
couple bloody marys at 11 am and it s tough to take the rest of the day
seriously truly a boozy beverage is the bane of brunch the key to
successful day drinking then is to go low and slow choose lower alcoholic
drinks low abv cocktails and set a nice plodding pace these cocktails skip
the strong spirits instead starting with a lower alcohol base such as wine
or beer extended with non alcoholic ingredients that make the drink last
longer while they were practically designed for day drinking low alcohol
drinks are equally recommended for cocktail parties or really any time when
lucidity and dexterity are prized they ll keep you on your feet for the long
haul and of course low alcohol cocktails are also great options if you re
simply looking to cut back on your alcohol consumption without abstaining
entirely

flavor is ok ended up adding a tad more honey but the texture was way too
dense and chewy are you sure you didn t mean almond flour instead of mealit s nearly impossible to incorporate the stiff egg whites into coarse almond
meal without them collapsing which probably accounts for the dense texture

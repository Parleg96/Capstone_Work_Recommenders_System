16 unbelievably soft sour cream cookie recipes

out on a fantastic cookie experience sour cream boasts high fat levels and a
fair amount of acidity both factors give baked goods a hefty dose of
moisture as well as a bright tangy flavor additionally sour cream does do
not thin out your batter as buttermilk or another liquid ingredient might 
which lends the baked cookies a tender fluffy texture so whether you just
need to use up some extra sour cream or want to enjoy some cookies with a
delightfully delicate crumb check out these sour cream cookie recipes and

13 great low alcoholic cocktails for day drinking

every day drinker knows the challenge of sipping when the sun s out enjoy a
couple bloody marys at 11 am and it s tough to take the rest of the day
seriously truly a boozy beverage is the bane of brunch the key to
successful day drinking then is to go low and slow choose lower alcoholic
drinks low abv cocktails and set a nice plodding pace these cocktails skip
the strong spirits instead starting with a lower alcohol base such as wine
or beer extended with non alcoholic ingredients that make the drink last
longer while they were practically designed for day drinking low alcohol
drinks are equally recommended for cocktail parties or really any time when
lucidity and dexterity are prized they ll keep you on your feet for the long
haul and of course low alcohol cocktails are also great options if you re
simply looking to cut back on your alcohol consumption without abstaining
entirely

the taste of this was okay but having followed the instructions to the t the
caramel didn t turn out it basically just turned into a brick of white
sugar so i started it over and used 3 tbsp of water and managed to get a
syrup the custard also had to cook for an extra 30 minutes to even begin to
set up in the end the taste was only average and definitely not worth all
the extra time

one of the easiest and yummiest dessert to prepare its my husband s favorite
few tips for the caramel heat the sugar with 5 6 tbsp water for a flowing
consistency over a high to medium flame and once it starts to caramalize 
reduce the flame and wait until it fully caramalizes once the custard is set
and cool invert it over a plate and servehttps //imagesvcmeredithcorpio/v3/mm/image url https 3a 2f 2fcam image

the caramel syrup never turned golden brownjust a white brick of sugar and
i guess i didn t let it cook long enough i did the recommended 45 minutes 
350 degrees fahrenheit because it tasted like sweet scrambled eggs i do like
the suggestions made by the other reviews i m not a super cook yet so i m
still learninghttps //imagesvcmeredithcorpio/v3/mm/image url https 3a 2f 2fcam image

the caramel syrup was just a white brick of sugar it kept separating i
switched to a different recipe for the sugar there needs to be a warning
about the eggs scrambling when added to hot milk for beginners since i knew
this i was able to avoid a potential screw up they also took way too long to
set and even when they did set they didn t turn out like the times i had made
them previously with different recipes

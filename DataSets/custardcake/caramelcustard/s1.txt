caramel cake also known as a caramel custard cake or leche flan is
decadent it s a classic smooth and soft dessert not too sweet but rich in
caramel flavor the texture is a combination of cake and a cr me caramel
thanks to the creamy caramel topping the cake consists of three distinct
layers baked in the same pan at the same time the bottom layer is light 
chiffon cake while the top is a smooth caramel custard there is a final 
thin layer of caramel on top once you try this three layer cake you wouldn t
want to eat any other desserthow to caramelize sugar 

you will need to caramelize sugar for this recipe but before you stress it s
really not that hard to do yourselfwhite sugar is most often used to make a
caramel applying heat to the sugar allows the sugar molecules to break down
into a liquid there are two ways to make a caramel a wet method and a dry
method for this recipe we used a dry method the advantage of the dry method
is that the caramelization process happens very quickly but this also means
that it burns quite quickly so make sure to keep an eye on itimmagine data image/svg xml 3csvg xmlns http //wwww3org/2000/svg

how to make caramel cake 

start by caramelizing sugar to do this sprinkle the sugar in a single
layer in a heavy bottomed pot over medium heat allow the sugar to melt
slowly making sure to keep an eye on it the whole time as it starts to melt 
use a rubber spatula to gently move the sugar around making sure all the
granules meltimmagine data image/svg xml 3csvg xmlns http //wwww3org/2000/svg

once the sugar melts it will start to caramelize very quickly turn the heat
to low if necessary continue until you achieve a deep brown colorimmagine data image/svg xml 3csvg xmlns http //wwww3org/2000/svg

recipe tips and notes 

1 this recipe is best served chilled with a handful of fresh berries2 if you have smaller cake tins you can also make mini caramel cakes don t make the cake too large as it will then become difficult to remove the cake from the pan without breaking it
3 to prepare a water bath you need to pour 1/3 to inch water into a large oven safe pan large enough to fit the cake pan and place in the preheating oven

the batter of the chocolate cupcakes was impossible to scoop into the cupcake
tins due to its thinness furthermore the recipe barely produced enough
batter for twelve cupcakes contrarily the recipe s directions were simple to
follow i own a home baking business and determine the above recipe of
chocolate cupcakes skeptically unfortunately i will not be using this recipe
again

i have tested a lot of chocolate cupcake recipes and this one is by far the
best the only comment i have is do not bake them for 25 minutes start
checking at 12 minutes in my oven they take about 15 minutes total

this recipe was amazingi made it exactly the way the recipe said and the
cake was very nice and moistthey are also fairly simple which is great
since all i wanted to do was ice them so while they were cooking it gave me
enough time to prepare the marshmallow fondant for the topping

very good flavor moist baked up nice the problem is like someone else
mentioned they are very delicate they were hard to frost because they are so
soft they fall apart when you try to peal them out of the wrapper i even
sprayed my papers first even when they are cold the batter was very runny
and i really felt less liquid was needed they were yummy though just not
something i d make for friends

i have made these cupcakes several times and while we love the flavor they
fall every time are very fragile and fall apart will have to find a
different cupcake recipe but keeping the frosting

the chocolate flavor is on the more subtle side but the texture is amazingi
followed the recipe to the t and had no issues i definitely recommend trying
iti think they would pair well with a strong dark chocolate frostinghttps //imagesvcmeredithcorpio/v3/mm/image url https 3a 2f 2fcam image

wowthese turned out fantastici did make a couple of substitutes olive oil
instead of veg milk instead of water and bourbon instead of vanilla i also
used dark cocoa not dutched i took them out a minute or two too early
about 23 min they still had a little sticky on the toothpick so i put them
back in for a few more minutes with the oven off they fell a little but
perfectly flat which was great for frosting the result was a fudgy brownie 
like center with a top that had a crispy sugary chew i topped them with a
billowy cream cheese bourbon frosting dusted with cocoa and a cinnamon candy
for color ps i made these for my husband on his birthday despite being in
the throes of back spasmsit is that easy except for reaching for the
milk

overall i really like this recipe the texture of the batter is smooth it
bakes really well and is not hard to make the only thing i would change is
the amount of cocoa in the batter the texture of the cupcakes were perfect 
but the taste was a bit bland

lol i m a pastry chef was so in a rush that i didn t completely read the
recipe like i should ve but these cupcakes still came out moist and fluffy
and full of flavor i creamed the butter and sugar instead of melting
everything together then added eggs an vanilla then flour also used shortening
instead of oil added chocolate chips to the batter for more chocolate 
i loved this recipejoy abo

loved it was looking for a chocolate cupcake to use up leftover cannoli
filling this was a great balance for the sweetness of the cannoli cream

definitely don t bake these for 25 minutesthey came out burnt on both the
bottoms and tops of all the cupcakes the flavor was just ok and the
chocolate frosting was the only good thing about these from my experience i
used the chocolate frosting from the recipe that s highlighted at the bottom
of the recipe

i really didnt like this recipe i followed it exactly but the cupcakes were
really bland and had almost no flavor at all it tasted like eating air some
may say that s a good thing but i couldn t even taste the chocolate was a
waste of time maybe it was an ok recipe for other people but not for me i
would say they don t match any flavor of frosting so if you want to try these
don t put frosting

made these for my niece s second birthday and they are so goodmy dad shook
his head in silent happiness as he devoured half a cupcake the night before
the party i will definitely be using the recipe again as a side note when i
filled the tins 3/4 of the way i got 9 very large cupcakes the second batch
i barely got 11 perfectly risen cupcakes when filled up 1/2 but i like my
cupcakes a little over the top so that s okhttps //imagesvcmeredithcorpio/v3/mm/image url https 3a 2f 2fcam image

this is my go to recipe for chocolate cupcakes i have tried it with hershey s
extra dark cocoa powder as well as other non dutch process i appreciate how
this recipe yields a cake that is not overly sweet with a moist crumb that
refrigerates well worth noting i do stretch the batter out and only fill up
the liners about halfway because of this the recipe can make 14 or 15
cupcakes i wound up making 65 of these cupcakes for a baby shower and these
were the hit of all the varieties that were brought a great frosting to
accommodate these is 8oz cream cheese whipped add 1 stick of softened 
unsalted butter just one t at a time and whip add 1 1/4 cup powdered sugar
and a t of vanilla and whip pipe then chill the cupcakes this combo is
perfection like a healthier dye free red velvet thanks food wine for the

pretty okay it s a dense brownie like batter but salvageable with some water 
coffee or maybe even some coca cola i made the recipe exactly as described
and didn t read reviews until i had already started but figured hey maybe
they miss read something or miss measured i was wrong however and the
batter turned out to be very thick like a brownie batter however i salvaged
my cupcakes by adding about 1/2 cup of water then about 1/8 cup of coffee
next time i would probably thin it out with all coffee or all water this
totally saved them even though they were still a little dense but very good
the cupcakes rose very well i set my timer for 15 min but they needed an
additional 5 min ps i added the coffee after the batter was already
complete and it worked fine so i would make the batter first and adjust coffee
measurements accordingly

total failure i m a great baker and followed this recipe exactly the
cupcakes rose then promptly fell just before they were done i only set my
timer for 20 minutes instead of the 25 that was recommended the batter was
quite thick more like a brownie batter the flavor is great just way too
thick and dense all is not lost i will freeze these and use them as brownie
sundae cups later in the week they just won t work as cupcakes for my
grandsons birthday

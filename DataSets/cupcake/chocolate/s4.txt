helpful tips

cake and cupcakes are more delicate than other baking recipes it s important
to weigh your ingredients for accurate measurements i own this kitchen
scale and use it almost every dayanother good tip is to use room
temperature ingredients this will ensure that everything mixes together
evenly for a smooth cupcake batter

use good quality cocoa powder this makes all the difference in the taste
both the cupcakes and the frostingi prefer ghirardelli unsweetened cocoa
powder cool the cupcakes completely before frosting other wise the
frosting will meltchocolate cupcake with chocolate frosting cut in half on top of paper

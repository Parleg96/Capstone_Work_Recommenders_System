how to make moist chocolate cupcakes,2,2,6,0,0,2,1,1,0
1 this recipe calls for vegetable oil instead of melted butter i went back and forth on this for a bit and wound up choosing the oil because it creates an ultra moist texture and open slightly spongy crumb which is perfect for chocolate cupcakes for more details on how these two fats affect tenderness flavor and texture check out my butter vs oil in baking article,1,2,67,1,1,22,8,1,0
2 since oil is liquid at room temperature it gives a better sensation of moistness than butter does,1,1,18,1,1,6,4,0,0
3 be sure to also use full fat ingredients and don t reduce the sugar in this recipe sugar actually helps contribute to moistness if you can believe it,0,1,29,1,1,6,8,0,0
4 lastly be sure not to accidentally over measure your flour and cocoa powder spoon both ingredients into their measuring cups then level off the excess with a knife or better yet use a digital kitchen scale check out my how to measure flour article for a step by step on how to accurately measure your dry ingredients,0,0,58,1,1,16,5,1,0

is there an egg substitute for chocolate cupcakes,0,2,8,0,0,4,1,1,0
i have yet to find an amazing egg substitute for this recipe my friend gemma,1,0,15,0,0,5,2,0,0
from bigger bolder baking has an excellent resource on egg substitutes,2,1,11,0,0,5,1,0,0
leavener,2,2,1,0,0,1,0,0,0
oh man this is where i encountered the most frustration i went back and,1,2,14,0,0,4,3,0,0
forth on this when i used both baking soda and baking powder the cupcakes,1,1,14,0,0,4,4,1,0
rose to a beautiful height while baking but then fell and collapsed slightly,1,1,13,0,0,1,4,0,0
as they cooled bummer that was too much leavener,2,1,9,0,0,2,2,0,0
i went back to only baking soda which is more effective per teaspoon than,1,2,14,0,0,3,3,1,0
baking powder but had to add vinegar to the recipe why,0,1,11,0,0,3,3,0,0
well because there,1,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0
wasn t much acid for the baking soda to react with originally dutch process,1,1,14,0,0,5,1,0,0
cocoa powder has been neutralized of its acid so it was only the sour cream,1,1,15,0,0,4,4,0,0
and small amount of brown sugar for tall and light cupcakes we need enough,1,1,14,0,0,4,1,1,0
leavening so baking soda vinegar did the trick this is why you omit the,1,1,14,0,0,3,5,0,0
vinegar if you re using natural cocoa powder,2,1,8,0,0,3,2,0,0
flour,2,2,1,0,0,1,0,0,0
i tried testing with bread flour after seeing a few ultimate recipes,1,2,12,0,0,3,3,0,0
elsewhere that used it but found that all purpose worked just as well since,1,1,14,0,0,0,3,0,0
all purpose flour is more readily available i stuck with that to make things,1,1,14,0,0,2,3,0,0
easiest for you,2,1,3,0,0,0,0,0,0
sour cream,2,2,2,0,0,1,0,0,0
i find that sour cream adds such a lovely richness and balance of flavor to,1,2,15,0,0,5,2,0,0
cupcakes so i just had to include it here i think it definitely works best,1,1,15,0,0,1,5,1,0
but full fat plain yogurt also makes a fine alternative in chocolate cupcakes,2,1,13,0,0,6,1,1,0
the chocolate buttercream frosting,2,2,4,0,0,3,0,0,0
when i originally published this recipe it used the more difficult chocolate,1,2,12,0,0,3,2,0,0
swiss meringue buttercream as the frosting although delicious it s more,1,1,11,0,0,3,1,0,0
advanced and requires more time and special equipment,2,1,8,0,0,2,1,0,0
in the interest of making this recipe easier but equally as delicious i,1,2,13,0,0,3,1,0,0
swapped in an american style chocolate buttercream that s made extra special,1,1,12,0,0,4,2,0,0
with two additions the frosting contains cooled chocolate ganache for extra,1,1,11,0,0,4,1,0,0
chocolate flavor and fudgy richness,2,1,5,0,0,4,0,0,0
for an extra smooth and rich frosting opt for organic powdered sugar and high,1,2,14,0,0,4,1,0,0
fat cocoa powder the full explanation for both is found here,2,1,11,0,0,3,2,0,0
my favorite cupcake tools,2,2,4,0,0,2,0,1,0
cupcake liners these ones are my favorite for cupcakes that don t stick to the liner,1,2,16,0,0,6,2,1,0
piping tip i used the ateco 828 piping tip for swirling on the chocolate frosting on these cupcakes any large open star tip will work,0,1,25,1,3,8,5,1,0
piping bags i love these ones,2,0,6,0,0,2,2,0,0

hi sonny,0,2,2,0,0,2,0,0,0
so happy to hear how much you love this recipe yay,0,0,11,0,0,2,2,0,0
these cupcakes,1,0,2,0,0,1,0,1,0
have a very small dome almost flat as you can see in some of the pictures,1,1,16,0,0,2,2,1,0
above the recipe making them perfect for piping do you have an oven,1,1,13,0,0,2,5,0,0
thermometer,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0
if not i d highly recommend getting one just to ensure that,1,0,12,0,0,0,3,0,0
your oven is at the accurate temperature flatter cupcakes can also happen if,1,1,13,0,0,4,2,1,0
your leaveners are expired more details here if the mixture was overmixed,1,1,12,0,0,3,3,0,0
though you said the consistency was great so i don t think that s the case,1,1,16,0,0,2,5,0,0
if the oven door was open too much or if too much batter was added to the,1,1,17,0,0,2,3,0,0
liner is it possible your liners were a little too full,0,1,11,0,0,2,2,0,0
i hope that helps,1,0,4,0,0,2,1,0,0

hi jen,0,2,2,0,0,2,0,0,0
the frosting uses melted chocolate for the most intense and pure,1,0,11,0,0,3,2,0,0
chocolate flavor possible we prefer to use semisweet but feel free to use,1,1,13,0,0,3,4,0,0
milk or bittersweet chocolate instead it s totally up to you,0,1,11,0,0,3,1,0,0
you won t need,1,0,4,0,0,1,2,0,0
to increase/reduce the amount of sugar but again use the type of chocolate,1,1,13,0,0,4,1,0,0
based on your personal preference just know that each chocolate will alter,1,1,12,0,0,2,3,0,0
the sweetness of the recipe i hope that helps,0,1,9,0,0,4,1,0,0

a couple weeks ago you might have seen me talk about the dream come true,1,2,15,0,0,4,3,0,0
experience of publishing the ultimate cookie handbook and having it sell out,1,1,12,0,0,3,3,0,0

well that exciting thing is no longer coming as soon as we d planned and now,1,2,16,0,0,1,5,0,0
i have to wait longer to even tell you what it is,2,1,12,0,0,1,4,0,0
so we were going to launch this brand new product in april but our inventory,1,2,15,0,0,4,3,0,0
got held up at the ports unexpectedly,2,1,7,0,0,1,2,0,0
we figured we d just delay the launch to may,2,2,10,0,0,1,3,0,0
then just before i left town for my 31st birthday trip at the end of march,1,2,16,1,2,4,1,0,0
we got the bad news,2,1,5,0,0,1,1,0,0
the new secret product we have been working so hard on for the last year had a,1,2,17,0,0,2,4,0,0
packaging flaw,2,1,2,0,0,2,0,0,0
it took all my energy not to panic,2,2,8,0,0,1,2,0,0
you see we had conducted test shipments of the product as part of our due,1,2,15,0,0,4,3,0,0
diligence this is when we discovered a problem the packaging on the inside,1,1,13,0,0,4,2,0,0
didn t secure the products as well as it should ve resulting in the contents,1,1,15,0,0,4,3,0,0
moving around and the packaging itself becoming damaged in some cases,2,1,11,0,0,2,3,0,0
the idea of any of my beloved hth customers spending their hard earned money,1,2,14,0,0,4,2,0,0
on our new product only to open the box to see the contents haphazardly,1,1,14,0,0,3,2,0,0
shuffled around inside or damaged packaging i couldn t let that happen,2,1,12,0,0,3,4,0,0
this is when my inner perfectionist took over and we decided to postpone the,1,2,14,0,0,0,4,0,0
launch until fall so we could have time to correct the packaging issue in,1,1,14,0,0,5,2,0,0
order to give our customers the best possible experience,2,1,9,0,0,3,1,0,0
it wasn t an easy decision,2,2,6,0,0,1,1,0,0
but i know it was the right decision because i wouldn t be able to sleep at,1,2,17,0,0,4,5,0,0
night without knowing we had done everything we could to do right by you guys,2,1,15,0,0,3,4,0,0
so sadly you ll have to wait until after summer to learn what this new,1,2,15,0,0,1,4,0,0
product is but trust me it ll be worth the wait,2,1,11,0,0,2,3,0,0
and a few good things have come out of this challenge we now have extra,1,2,15,0,0,3,3,0,0
time to work on another project that we ve been planning to do for a while,2,1,16,0,0,3,5,0,0

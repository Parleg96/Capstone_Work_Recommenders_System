how to make chocolate cupcakes1 mix together wet ingredients eggs oil buttermilk coffee vanilla 
2 mix together dry ingredients flour sugar cocoa powder baking powder baking soda 
3 dump dry mixture into wet mixture and mix
4 pour batter in cupcake liners
5 bake
6 ice cupcakes 
7 enjoyhow to make moist chocolate cupcake recipemoisture comes from rich ingredients that are high in fat so use full fat
ingredients use whole milk or buttermilk instead of fat free or low fat milk
use butter instead of oil although today s recipe is an exception and
requires oil

what makes best homemade fluffy cupcakesthat s a result of the air bubbles that you whip into the batter that end up expanding in the oven during baking however if the batter is over mixed those bubbles end up collapsing and the cupcakes don t fully rise and can sink too that s why you should only mix the cake batter until just combined
also measure ingredients properly because baking is science and those measurements and ingredients combine together to create the best fluffy texture

can you freeze cupcakesyes unfrosted cupcakes can be stored in an air tight sealed freezer bag or
container for up to 1 month let them thaw in the fridge or at room
temperature and then ice them with frostinghomemade chocolate cupcakes from

easy chocolate cupcake frosting

the classic choice is obviously chocolate buttercream frosting i also have a
very fudgy coconut cream chocolate frosting that s amazing however there are
are many other delicious flavor combinations try out some of these pairings 

american buttercream frosting this is super sweet and will easily balance the rich and intense chocolate flavor 
marshmallow frosting if you are fond of s mores you need to give this a shot 
cream cheese frosting another classic frosting that works on pretty much all cakes and cupcakes it s not as sweet and has a subtle tanginess 
white chocolate buttercream frosting this is a great way to incorporate white chocolate in these cupcakes 
homemade whipped cream make it at home or just use cool whip it s the least sweet and the simplest of all the icings 

for a fruity flavor combination try any of the following fruit based frosting
recipes 

maraschino cherry frosting
orange frosting
strawberry buttercream frosting

filled cupcakes

the classic choice is obviously chocolate ganache because it truly enhances
the chocolate flavor it s also super rich and creamy

you can also try other fillings like various flavors of jams and spreads such
as this homemade strawberry jam or peanut butter and other nut butters and
even nutella

you can even fill them with fresh berries eg raspberries strawberries 
blackberries etc let s not forget about pie fillings such as this
raspberry pie filling or this cherry pie filling or this strawberry pie
filling all of these fillings can be homemade or store boughtchocolate cupcakes with chocolate

variations

german chocolate cupcakes pair these cupcakes with a classic coconut pecan frosting 
vegan chocolate cupcakes use this recipe instead of modifying the recipe below
sugar free chocolate cupcakes use this recipe instead of modifying the recipe below
chocolate chip cupcakes stir in 1/3 cup mini chocolate chips in the cupcake batter and also top off the frosted cupcakes with mini chocolate chips 
chocolate peanut butter cupcakes pair these cupcakes with peanut butter frosting and a drizzle of melted peanut butter and finally top off with chopped roasted peanuts 
mini cupcakes use a mini cupcake pan to make smaller cupcakes watch them closely while baking to prevent them from becoming over baked and dry
decorate iti kept it simple and decorated with a simple swirl of frosting but you can toss chocolate chips chopped candies chocolate shreds sprinkles and even fresh flowers

tips and techniques

all ingredients must be at room temperature because this allows them to blend together smoothly and evenly
only use all purpose flour don t replace all purpose flour with any other flour because it does not yield the same good results i have various other flours including whole wheat and gluten free and neither tasted great the only other flour that still yielded good results was homemade cake flour
don t over mix cupcake batter because that will yield very tough cupcakes and there is a higher probability of them sinking in the center during baking 
frost cool cupcakes allow the cupcakes to fully cool down before frosting them because that prevents the frosting from melting all over the cupcakes and making a mess
serve a crowd recipe can easily be doubled to serve more people you will have to bake in batches though if you don t have multiple ovens 
oil vs butter typically i am a big fan of butter but in order to make these cupcakes fluffy oil has to be used to give them an airy texture butter tends to make them very dense
both baking powder and baking soda are required don t replace one with the other because that will alter the texture of this cake
use warm brewed coffee because if it s too hot it will start cooking the eggs in the batter it cannot be boiling hot
don t use dark chocolate this is with regards to cocoa powder because it makes the cupcakes too bitter
how to make homemade buttermilki know this is not an ingredient many of us have on hand all the time but no worries make a great buttermilk substitute at home by mixing together 1 cup whole milk with 1 tbsp vinegar or lemon juice let it sit for 5 minutes mix and then use in this recipe
don t replace buttermilk with whole milk because buttermilk adds a lot of moisture to the cupcakes and makes it super soft

how to make a rainbow layer cake with sprinkles

this rainbow cake is bright fun and deliciousthe steps below will guide you
through how to make a rainbow cake from scratch

top tip bake cakes on the middle oven rack if possible if you don t
have space for 6 tins in your oven then you can half the recipe below and make
three cakes first and then bake the remaining three

1 start by greasing 6 non stick 6 cake tins with butter or oil and line them with baking paper if necessary
2 next add 700g of room temperature butter to a large bowl
3 add 700g of sifted caster sugar
4 whisk for 3 5 minutes or until pale yellowgreased baking tin room temperature butter in a bowl caster sugar and room
temperature butter in a bowl https //simshomekitchencom/wp 
content/uploads/2021/05/rainbow cake batterjpg 

5 add 1 tsp of vanilla extract to the mixture then measure 700g of room
temperature eggs add one into the bowl and whisk until the egg is no longer
visible

6 repeat the previous step for the remaining eggs if you add all of the
eggs at once the mixture may split and curdle the mixture should look smooth
and silky

7 add 350g of sifted self raising flour to the mixture and 2 3 tbsp of room
temperature milk and mix

8 repeat the previous step with the remaining 350g of self raising flour and
milk then mix note do not overmix the cake batter as you still need to mix
in food coloring overmixing will result in a tough cakehttps //simshomekitchencom/wp content/uploads/2021/05/rainbow cake 
batter without food colouring 1jpg 

9 you will need red orange yellow green blue and violet food colouring
i suggest you use gel as the colours come out a lot more vibrant add equal
amounts of the cake batter to six different bowls and add 1/8 1/4 tsp of each
food colouring and mix until well combinedred orange yellow green blue and violet cake
batter https //simshomekitchencom/wp content/uploads/2021/05/red orange 
yellow green blue and violet cake batter 683x1024jpg 

10 add each colored cake batter into the greased 6 tins and bake for 30
minutes or until done to test if your cake is ready stick a knife into the
cake if it comes out clean then it is done but if it is wet with cake batter
then it s not ready once the cakes are ready leave them to cool completely on
a cooling rack before decorating

as you can see from the image below not all of the cakes appear to be the
right color don t worry this is perfectly normal because most cakes get burnt
on the outside all you need to do is use a knife to shave off the burnt bits
and the color will come throughrainbow cake layers cooling down https //simshomekitchencom/wp

top tips

cake tins this cake is tall as i used 6 cake tins you can also use 7 
tins or 8 tins however be aware that the cake layers will be thinner

different proportions you can double or triple this recipe depending on
how many people you need to feed if you want to make a smaller amount then be
aware that the cake layers will be thinner and this can sometimes be difficult
to decorate

ingredients make sure that all of the ingredients are room temperature
sift all of the dry ingredients before mixing

overmixing batter do not overmix the batter because the cake will become
tough

baking cakes should be baked on the middle shelf baking cakes on the top
shelf can result in dry burnt cakes and baking cakes on the bottom shelf can
take longer add cakes to the oven as soon as possible for the best results
also do not open the oven in the first 20 minutes of baking

moisture if you want to add more moisture to the cake then heat a 1 1
ratio of water and sugar in a saucepan to create a syrup bring to a boil 
simmer for 10 minutes and leave to cool

different ways to decorate you can decorate this cake in lots of
different ways if you want a simple look then skip the sprinkles and frost
the cake with vanilla buttercream you can also add chocolate drip or use

what is rainbow cake made ofrainbow cake is made of layers of vanilla cake colored with food coloring

is gel food coloring better than liquidgel food coloring is better than liquid coloring because the colors come out a
lot more vibrant gel food coloring is made with synthetic coloring water 
and corn syrup or a glycerin base this makes the texture thick and gel like
whereas liquid food coloring is made with synthetic coloring and has a water
base this makes it more liquid and causes the colors to come out pale

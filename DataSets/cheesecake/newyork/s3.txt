i am a little nervous i followed this recipe word by word after pouring the
sou cream mixture over the cake i baked it for 5 minutes as it says in the
recipe my concern is that when i took it out of the oven it looks very runny
is it suppose to do that and will it firm up in the refrigerator other than
that it looks like a great recipehttps //imagesvcmeredithcorpio/v3/mm/image url https 3a 2f 2fcam image

very smooth no hard areas perfect uncracked top fantastic flavor do
include the cream of tartar i baked mine the full 50 minutes in a water bath 
then put on the sour cream topping left it in the oven 5 min then cracked
the door and let it cool i admit i used vanilla wafers for the crust because
i like em better i don t like my cheesecake to be cakey i like it totally
smooth and this recipe is the one i ll use for the rest of my life kitchen

this is very good foolproof recipe i made/baked it exactly as directed no
water bath no leaving in the oven nothing except i always use less sugar
even though i am crazy about sugar and everything it goes into but all
recipes usually call for way too much of it 1/8 cup sugar to the crust 3/4
or less to the cream cheese mix 1/3 or less to the sour cream mix but it
will taste all right if made with all sugar too o if you are going to put
sweet fruit topping on top you may want to use less sugar in the cake i also
never have a cream of tartar bummer i just put 1 tsp lemon juice do not
over beat eggsno cracks everbut it wouldn t matter because you re going to
cover it with sour cream i baked it longer the first time because it was
wobbly in the middle then i baked longer than 5 minutes with sour cream mix
on top but you don t have to do it 50 and 5 minutes is enough anyway even
over baked it tasted great i don t think you can ruin this excellent recipe
you don t have to be a perfect baker to make this cake takes minutes to mix
everything up so easy thank you so muchps i made it dozens of times 
comes out perfect every timehttps //imagesvcmeredithcorpio/v3/mm/image url https 3a 2f 2fcam image

my family loves this cheesecake it may seem complicated but its easier than
it looks the 1 trick i used was to leave the cheesecake in the oven after its
done baking i simply turn off the oven and open the door half way i leave it
for 2hrs or so then place in the fridge no cracks every time

okay so officially my first cheesecake and it turned out pretty good this
recipe is reallly good though it doesn t really give the information about
like a water bath and like small tips and stuff mine didnt crackki was so
relieved because reading everyone s comments had scared me so much i layered
my springform pan with two sheets of aluminium foil and then greased that i
then pressed my crust into the pan with the aluminium foil on it and put it
in the preheated oven for just five minutes i poured my filling into the
crust and put the springform pan into a water bath basically any dish filled
with around 1 inch of water then i left the cheesecake in to bake for fifty
minutes after which i opened the door of the oven a crack and left it for 15
minutes then i shut the door and left the cheesecake there for 45 minutes i
took it out let it cool and then after covering it with plastic i left it in
the fridge overnight all my ingredients were at room temperature and i beat
the cream for may be even less than a minute with an electric mixer the rest
i did with a fork because i didn t want to overbeat it i definitely will make
this againeveryone loved itthe only complaint was that it was too sweet
and that next time not only should i use less sugar but i should also use
powdered and not granulated sugar thank you soo mcuh for the recipehttps //imagesvcmeredithcorpio/v3/mm/image url https 3a 2f 2fcam image

i made this as written the first time and it didn t turn out it was very
curdled the second time i used only 3 eggs and left out the cream of tartar
but more important i reduced the oven temp to 275 degrees after 50 minutes
it was perfectly done and one of the best cheesecakes i ve ever made contrary
to these instructions it is okay if the middle is still a little jiggly when
you take it out the stored heat will make it set the worst thing you can do
to cheesecake is overcook itthe lower temp helps with this even if you
sometimes have to cook it a little bit longerhttps //imagesvcmeredithcorpio/v3/mm/image url https 3a 2f 2fcam image

this recipe has really become a hit with us first made it as a groom s cake
for a wedding a few weeks ago topped with a champagne maserated fresh
blueberry topping then made it again with my fresh strawberries and
strawberry all fruit jam champagne reduction with just a touch of powdered
sugar and melted butter topping took a couple of spoonfuls of the strawberry
mixture and folded them into the sour cream mixture just before baking the
folks at work devoured the cheesecake in no time flat now have to make it
again for christmas eve with the whole family gathering i am not so good at
pastry more a savory cook but this is now a new family tradition also 
added the zest of a small lemon to the sour cream mixture

i love this recipe i found that i had enough cream cheese mixture to make two
8 pies i also found that if you whip the sour cream topping ingredients
until they are stiff it doesn t run and makes the pie absolutely beautiful i

after experimenting a few times i found it best to line spring form pan with
parchment paper and use a stand mixer on 4 speed and the paddle head from
start to finish all ingredients room temp and softened mix cream cheese for
about 8 10 mins until smooth add sugar and continue to let it mix for 5 mins 
add vanilla and cream of tartar and mix for 2 mins scrape sides and bottom
of bowl occasionally between additions here s the delicate part while
continuing to mix with all eggs in measuring cup or bowl add/spill in eggs
one at a time as you see the yolk pop and blend add the next do not over mix
once you add the forth egg use a baking spatula to scrape down side and turn
off mixer use spatula to scrape and fold mix from bottom of bowl pour into
crust prepared pan bake for 50 mins following remaining instructions to sour
cream after baking sour cream on for 5 mins let sit for one hr in pan then
remove clasp and use a knife or large icing spatula to run underneath entire
cake grip pan on one side and help cake off pan with knife or spatula on the
other side onto a plate or board the cake will be a bit flexible which helps
the transfer yet but can damage if you drop on plate glide it down closely
to plate if in a hurry microwave the three cream cheese on a plate for 45
secs then mix for 10 mins until creamy and smooth for the eggs soak in hot
water for one to two mins then take out

i did not think this recipe was going to work well i was convinced the sour
cream layer would never set boy was i wrong the cheesecake was beautifuleverything set well and it looked great no cracks and the sour cream layer
keeps you from getting that slightly overdone top to the cheesecake i never
liked i also added cinnamon to the crust the cake improves as a day or two
passes and is a nice consistency i prefer a dense cheesecake as opposed to
the fluffy types and this nice not too heavy it is sweet but the sour cream
layer works very well may family loved it and demanded i make anotherterri

if anyone has some advice on when i take the cake from the oven for the 5
minutes as suggested the middle settles and i always have a ridge around the
edge no cracks and it doesn t hurt the taste but there is a ridge around

i made this for easter dinner and everyone raved about it my son said it was
the best cheesecake he s ever eaten if you are looking for a dense
cheesecake this is not the recipe for you it has a very smooth texture and
is moist i stuck to the recipe as written except subbed reduced fat cream
cheese and sour cream i don t know how it could have been any better with
full fat ingredients this will be my go to recipe for a ny style cheesecake

this is by far the best cheesecake i have ever tasted kudos to kitchen
queenfirst off this is the first time i ever made cheesecake and i thought
the directions were and easy to follow second i don t have a springform pan
and the pan i had was smaller than what the recipe called for so when i
poured the batter in it filled up really full i scooped some out and then
reduced the sour cream mixture at the end despite the minor adjustments it
was still amazingincredibly smooth and rich i will definitely make this

i followed the recipe to the letter it is very quick and easy however the
texture is a light and fluffy one i was hoping for a more dense type of
cheesecake the flavor is very good though thanks for sharing

this is my go to recipe each time i make a cheese cake it s easy to make and
turns out great every time you make it i do a couple of things differently to
keep the cake from cracking first i add the eggs last one at a time next i
use a butter knife to run thru the top of the cake to get rid of any bubbles
next i put a pan of water on the bottom rack of the oven finally i preheat
at 350 degrees per the recipe but i turn it down to 325 when putting the
cheesecake in the oven and bake for 60 minutes instead of 50 minutes

made with vanilla wafer crust and used extra strong pure vanilla extract and
topped with salted caramel sauce also found on all recipes de de de 
liciousi figured 16 servings since very rich but 10 people wiped it out in
one sittingcan be made with many flavors of crust and a multitude of
toppings but since i m not a huge chocolate fan the vanilla and salted
caramel were divinefollowed directions exactly except vanilla wafer crust
and lots of top dollar vanilla 8

aficianados said it was the best they have had only change i would make is
less on the sour cream topping it was pretty thick and a little too tart for
my younger son and even me who loves tart things of course adding chocolate
to the topping would helpnext time i will try that

eh this was not too my taste i m used to the thick new york style which is
what i was looking for this one is ok at best to me the top helpful review
called it involved i wouldn t call it involved at all unless they re
referring to adding the sour cream top of which i could definitely do
without this was really a pretty basic recipe compared to another i tried
which was a thicker consistency i did see another recipe that i ll probably
try that looks to be the thicker style i m looking for

i baked it at 400 degrees for 15 minutes and then reduced it to 200 degrees
for an additional 35 minutes i took it out at that time and frosted it with
the sour cream and baked it for an additional 10 minutes i left it in the
oven with the heat turned off until cooled and then refrigerated i topped it
with a raspberry pie filling and fresh raspberries the sour cream topping was
a perfect foil for the sweet topping will absolutely make again

i can t stop eating this cakei made this cheesecake because i wanted to use
it as a vehicle for some delicious pomegranate vinegar i have in the pantry 
but it ended up stealing the show i followed the directions and my cake did
crack a bit but the sour cream topping hid all flaws i grew up on no bake
cheesecake and i ve always secretly hated actual cheesecake but this recipe
is so moist and creamy i think it s perfect i did change one teeeeensy thing
when making it i added a bit of salt to the graham cracker crust i just
think graham cracker crusts always taste better that way

recipe i have foundplain or new york cheesecake has always been my favorite 
and this one is perfect just the right amount of sweetness for those of my
guests that prefer fruit topped cheese cake i added it after i sliced it to
add the option of plain or not it tastes good both ways but to me better
plain this recipe will become my favorite now i made it for my son s
birthday and will now make it for my sister at her suprise 50th this year i
made the recipe just as described and wouldn t change a thing as you

this is my first cheesecake ever my sister normally bakes the philadelphia
cream cheese recipe but it s just too rich to eat in my opinion this
cheesecake blends richness and creaminess perfectly it did crack just
slightly on the side but easily covered up by sour cream topping i added
freshly squeezed lemon juice and topped with bananas and blueberry topping
family loved it i will bake this one again for the holidaysi did follow
directions exactly besides the lemon juice kitchenqueen has it together on

this is very good foolproof recipe i made/baked it exactly as directed no,1,2,13,0,0,3,3,0,0
water bath no leaving in the oven nothing except i always use less sugar,1,1,14,0,0,5,1,0,0
even though i am crazy about sugar and everything it goes into but all,1,1,14,0,0,2,2,0,0
recipes usually call for way too much of it 1/8 cup sugar to the crust 3/4,1,1,16,1,4,5,1,1,0
or less to the cream cheese mix 1/3 or less to the sour cream mix but it,1,1,17,1,2,4,0,0,0
will taste all right if made with all sugar too o if you are going to put,1,1,17,0,0,2,5,0,0
sweet fruit topping on top you may want to use less sugar in the cake i also,1,1,17,0,0,4,3,0,0
never have a cream of tartar bummer i just put 1 tsp lemon juice do not,1,1,16,1,1,7,3,1,0

but it wouldn t matter because you re going to,1,0,10,0,0,1,3,0,0
cover it with sour cream i baked it longer the first time because it was,1,1,15,0,0,4,2,0,0
wobbly in the middle then i baked longer than 5 minutes with sour cream mix,1,1,15,1,1,4,1,0,0
on top but you don t have to do it 50 and 5 minutes is enough anyway even,1,1,18,1,3,2,4,0,0
over baked it tasted great i don t think you can ruin this excellent recipe,1,1,15,0,0,1,5,0,0
you don t have to be a perfect baker to make this cake takes minutes to mix,1,1,17,0,0,4,6,0,0

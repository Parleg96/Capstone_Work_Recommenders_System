one of the very best cheesecakes i have ever madeit did not taste reduced
fat in any way the cheesecake was very moist and creamy the blueberries
provided a little tang and the sour cream topping made it perfect i did
double the topping recipe for the dinner i took it to as some people used a
bit more topping than allottedany leftover blueberries are great on toast
my cheesecake was done right on time so make sure to check so it doesn t
over cook

this was literally the best cheesecake i have ever eaten everit far
surpasses any restaurant cheesecake including cheesecake factory and it is
perfectly not too rich i would give this recipe 5 thousand stars it even
turned my mother into a cheesecake loverthank you thank you thank you for
letting me in on this wonderfully delicious bandwaggon of delightps the
only thing i would change is the amount of sugar used it s enough to awaken
my acne for months to come but sooo worth ittanyamichelle

although it is a little time consuming it is definitely worth it i followed
the recipe except i only 1/3 less fat cream cheese no fat free ccheese and
it came out amazing the recipe also fits to a 9 x 13 cake pan i cut out
little squares and put them on cupcake paper for easier serving

this recipe is one of my favorites and gets requested all the time i use
another cup of blueberries and a bit more cornstarch so that i can reduce the
puree more and make it very flavorful

this recipe is incredible i make a lot of cheesecakes and this may now be one
of my all time favourites it s now my man s favourite it s not too dense
like many recipes can be i used fresh regular blueberries instead of wild 
regular sour cream instead of light the only recommendation would be that the
initial blueberry filling did not yield enough to put aside the extra 1/2 cup
for the final sauce so i had to make more made about 50 more than recipe
called for also as another reader suggested i had to bake it for about 20
min longer than suggested prior to putting on sour cream topping make this
it s a sure hitmartindredmond

this is an outstanding recipe doesn t have the usual flavor/fat trade off it
was creamy and deliciousfairly easy to make and it disappeared in a couple
of days substituted some leftover port i had for water in the sauce i cooked
in a water bath though with the topping in retrospect it wasn t necessary
turned out quite well will make again

this was a great recipethe only thing i changed was that i used neufchatel
cheese for everything the blueberry sauce was fantastic and the sour cream
toppping was delicious the only thing i had trouble with was the swirl
pattern i just need more practice with that this is the first time i d tried
swirling

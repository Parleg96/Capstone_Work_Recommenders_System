very good recipe however i have one question the batter which we prepared,1,2,13,0,0,3,2,0,0
with corn flour and maida is very sticky and adhesive like paste it is very,1,1,15,0,0,4,2,0,0
difficult to take paneer cubes out of it what is the solution for this,1,1,14,0,0,3,2,0,0
problem,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0
response hi satish,1,0,3,0,0,3,0,0,0
it is normal if batter turns sticky like paste it happens because of the corn,1,1,15,0,0,3,3,0,0
flour whenever you mix corn flour with water and keep it idle for long,1,1,14,0,0,4,2,0,0
duration it will turn sticky to overcome with this problem just stir the,1,1,13,0,0,2,3,0,0
batter with a spoon and it will turn normal within a minute,1,1,12,0,0,3,1,0,0
in this recipe you can skip marinating the paneer cubes in step 1 just,1,1,14,1,1,4,2,0,0
prepare the batter dip each cube in it and deep fry,2,1,11,0,0,4,1,0,0

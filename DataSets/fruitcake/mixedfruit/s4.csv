brandy i also cooked the cake for 3 hours i made it twice the second time i,1,1,17,1,1,6,2,0,0

aged the cakes longer more brandy applied less frequently like everyone,1,1,11,0,0,2,2,0,0
else mine took about 3 hours to bake and longer wouldn t have hurt i think,1,1,16,1,1,4,5,0,0

cherries instead of raisins and i used rum i also put the cake in small loaf,1,1,16,0,0,7,2,1,0
pans instead of a bundt pan i think the baking time is off as it took more,1,1,17,0,0,6,3,0,0

omg this is the best i cannot imagine why anyone would not like this,1,2,14,0,0,3,3,0,0
fruitcake the only thing i changed was i used only one tablespoon of,1,1,13,0,0,4,4,1,0
cloves because they can so easily be overwhelming and that seemed like a,1,1,13,0,0,1,4,0,0
problem some people were having other than that i went by the recipe,1,1,13,0,0,3,3,0,0
including baking in a pretty bundt pan it baked for 3 hours i think that,1,1,15,1,1,4,3,0,0
must be a typo in the recipe there is no way this thing could could in one,1,1,17,0,0,4,2,0,0
hour and i allowed it to cool completely before attempting to take it out,1,1,14,0,0,2,4,0,0
of my pan it popped right out and it is gorgeous it overflowed a bit,1,1,15,0,0,2,3,0,0
but that was okay because i was able to eat the edges and they were amazing,1,1,16,0,0,2,5,0,0

i m an experienced cook but i d never previously had the foresight to make a,1,2,16,0,0,3,4,0,0
fruitcake before the season until now first discovery was that these things,1,1,12,0,0,4,1,0,0
are hellaciously expensive to make second this is a poor choice for a,1,1,13,0,0,1,3,0,0
fruitcake and i do believe the fault lies with the tempering i followed the,1,1,14,0,0,5,4,0,0
instructions thoroughly and my cake was dry it felt moist enough and i could,1,1,14,0,0,2,3,0,0
never get it to accept more than 2 tbsp of brandy but was dry upon eating,1,1,16,1,1,2,4,1,0
also 2 tbsp of cloves is such serious overkill too much cloves lastly it,1,1,14,1,1,3,2,1,0
could have been sweeter which given the ingredients might seem odd still,1,1,12,0,0,1,4,0,0
the sweet factor was minimal research after the fact has shown me that the,1,1,14,0,0,3,3,0,0
cakes need to be wrapped in a brandy soaked cloth and placed in an airtight,1,1,15,0,0,4,5,0,0
container i might make this again but with changes as it stands a 3,2,1,14,1,1,3,2,0,0

is that spice will never make this again and consider it a total waste of,1,1,15,0,0,2,3,0,0
some costly ingredients plus it took twice as long to cook as noted and i,1,1,15,0,0,1,2,0,0

this took nearly 2 hours then the firnal part of recipe did not state to,1,2,15,1,1,4,2,0,0
either turn upside down or leave in pan or anything just cool on wire rack,1,1,15,0,0,6,1,0,0
so i thought it needed to invert well it broke apart but it is delish so,1,1,16,0,0,0,5,0,0
next time i know to leave it in pan set at higher setting and bake for longer,1,1,17,0,0,5,3,0,0

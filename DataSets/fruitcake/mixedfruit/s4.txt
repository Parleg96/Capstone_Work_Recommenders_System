16 unbelievably soft sour cream cookie recipes

out on a fantastic cookie experience sour cream boasts high fat levels and a
fair amount of acidity both factors give baked goods a hefty dose of
moisture as well as a bright tangy flavor additionally sour cream does do
not thin out your batter as buttermilk or another liquid ingredient might 
which lends the baked cookies a tender fluffy texture so whether you just
need to use up some extra sour cream or want to enjoy some cookies with a
delightfully delicate crumb check out these sour cream cookie recipes and

13 great low alcoholic cocktails for day drinking

every day drinker knows the challenge of sipping when the sun s out enjoy a
couple bloody marys at 11 am and it s tough to take the rest of the day
seriously truly a boozy beverage is the bane of brunch the key to
successful day drinking then is to go low and slow choose lower alcoholic
drinks low abv cocktails and set a nice plodding pace these cocktails skip
the strong spirits instead starting with a lower alcohol base such as wine
or beer extended with non alcoholic ingredients that make the drink last
longer while they were practically designed for day drinking low alcohol
drinks are equally recommended for cocktail parties or really any time when
lucidity and dexterity are prized they ll keep you on your feet for the long
haul and of course low alcohol cocktails are also great options if you re
simply looking to cut back on your alcohol consumption without abstaining
entirely

this is the perfect fruitcake recipie the only changes i made were to double
the amount of brandy and used it to soak the fruits for 24 hours before making
the cake good cake texture and not too much fruit the cake mixture using
four eggs filled an eight inch round tin and took three and a half hours to
bake at the stated temperature thanks for sharing

i thought this was the best fruitcake i ve eaten i was specifically looking
for a recipe that called for real dried fruit no candied stuff my daughter 
in law and i made 3 of them a month ago we waited a month to eat any it is
so moist and very spicey i brushed on a little brandy every other day for
about the first 10 days after baking then just left it wrapped even family
members who questioned why we would make a fruitcake liked this one

great fruitcake i soaked my dried fruit mix in rum and i used rum instead of
brandy i also cooked the cake for 3 hours i made it twice the second time i
added one cup applesauce because i had read it makes the cake moister big
mistake the cakes did not turn out well at all thank you for sharing

excellenti soaked my fruits and nuts in brandy for a week in advance and
aged the cakes longer more brandy applied less frequently like everyone
else mine took about 3 hours to bake and longer wouldn t have hurt i think
a lot depends on whether your image of fruitcake is dry or wet

i love this recipe i did change a few things i added choc chips and dried
cherries instead of raisins and i used rum i also put the cake in small loaf
pans instead of a bundt pan i think the baking time is off as it took more
than 2 hours instead of the 1 recommended i got rave reviews from fruitcake
lovers and from non lovers too

this is an awesomely good recipe i have never been fond of the candied fruit
cake my mother makes i used the brandy to soak into the dried fruit simply
because i can t stand to not change a recipe and then doubled it and used
loaf pans i made a mistake i used three but really four need to be used my
children love this and my mother has asked for the recipe

i went to make this cake 3 1/2 weeks before christmas and discovered i only
had one egg i used egg substitute and a little nut oil instead as such i
don t think i can rate this cake fairly considering a fruitcake has so many
ingredients it is vitally important to follow the recipe exactly that being
said i did make this cake and because i didn t have enough eggs it was
slightly crumbly i should have left the cake to cool in the pan as once it
was cool it was alot easier to remove tip to line the bottom of a round
cake pan with non stick paper turn your pan upside down and measure a square
of paper so that it hangs over the edges by an inch then fold that square in
half exactly and then in half again now fold it into half again so that it is
in a triangle shape put the point of the triangle in the center of your
upside down pan and then with kitchen scissors cut the excess paper that hangs
over the edge in a curve when you unfold the paper it will be in a circle
that fits exactly into the pan i did have excess batter and used another
pan so i could taste it it is very rich and heavy just like a fruitcake
should be i have never had nuts in a fruitcake and don t know if i really
like them in there it took three and a half hours to bake at the stated
temperature it is now in the fridge and covered with alfoil in a cake
container sprinkled with a mix of frangelico hazelnut liquor and brandy and
bourbon every 2 3 day i will update after xmashttps //imagesvcmeredithcorpio/v3/mm/image url https 3a 2f 2fcam image

aluminum foil placed them in ziplock bags and left them alone for a month to
age wow was this ever goodvery spicy moist it tastes wonderful with a
good strong cup of coffee i hope this month goes by fast i can t wait to

omg this is the best i cannot imagine why anyone would not like this
fruitcake the only thing i changed was i used only one tablespoon of
cloves because they can so easily be overwhelming and that seemed like a
problem some people were having other than that i went by the recipe 
including baking in a pretty bundt pan it baked for 3 hours i think that
must be a typo in the recipe there is no way this thing could could in one
hour and i allowed it to cool completely before attempting to take it out
of my pan it popped right out and it is gorgeous it overflowed a bit 
but that was okay because i was able to eat the edges and they were amazing
i cannot wait until christmas to eat and share the rest with dinnerhttps //imagesvcmeredithcorpio/v3/mm/image url https 3a 2f 2fcam image

this was my first time making fruitcake and it turned out excellent i m
giving the recipe 4 stars instead of 5 because it needs some modifications i
followed the advice of past reviewers i soaked the dried fruit in brandy for
a day and i baked the fruitcake for 3 hours at 225 i used dried cherries 
cranberries and apricots in addition to the raisins another modification i
made was to cut the spices in half i like a lot of spices but i feel that if
i had put in the amount in the recipe it would have been overpowering i
doubled the recipe and it filled 6 medium loaf pans i think they were 3 x 5 
my husband and i sampled one of the loaves right out of the oven and it was
delicious i have the remaining loaves resting in the refrigerator and will
drizzle brandy on them occasionally i will add more information to this
review after the loaves have sat for a couple of weeks i think that there
could have been more fruit and nuts added but i ll see what it tastes like
after it has sat

i have to say the initial flavor of the batter was good however after
sitting and curing the taste of cloves was so strong that we couldn t eat it
i was so upset i think it would be good if there were actually no cloves in
there at all

i m an experienced cook but i d never previously had the foresight to make a
fruitcake before the season until now first discovery was that these things
are hellaciously expensive to make second this is a poor choice for a
fruitcake and i do believe the fault lies with the tempering i followed the
instructions thoroughly and my cake was dry it felt moist enough and i could
never get it to accept more than 2 tbsp of brandy but was dry upon eating
also 2 tbsp of cloves is such serious overkill too much cloves lastly it
could have been sweeter which given the ingredients might seem odd still 
the sweet factor was minimal research after the fact has shown me that the
cakes need to be wrapped in a brandy soaked cloth and placed in an airtight
container i might make this again but with changes as it stands a 3

this recipe was so good i ve never liked fruitcake and neither have most of
the other people who tried this one and loved it i soaked the fruit in brandy
for a few days and then added the additional brandy required by the recipe i
used pecans baked for about 1 hour and 10 minutes and only added the
additional tablespoons of brandy twice it smelled so strong i decided to
leave it alone waited only 25 weeks and it was still fantastichttps //imagesvcmeredithcorpio/v3/mm/image url https 3a 2f 2fcam image

absolutely raved about this recipeeven though it took a lot of time to make

i feel real bad giving this such a low rating but i saw all the stars and
automatically started to make itwhen i got to the spices and started
measuring i thought whewthat s a lot of clovesi continued and whoa it s
just too muchi think if you halved all the spices it would be better it s
easy to mix up tsp and tbsp maybe that happenedmainly too much cloves and
allspiceall due respect to your dear grandmotheri raised the heat to 325
and kept an eye on it used 1 med and 2 smaller loaf panstook over an hour
and a halfa good white frosting helped cut the spice it tasted like clove
cake and was a little crumbly coming out of the pan s other than that edible 
but sorry its too spicyhttps //imagesvcmeredithcorpio/v3/mm/image url https 3a 2f 2fcam image

i am new to baking fruit cakes and this cake was not done after 1 hour i
recommend baking for 35 hours but maybe that s my oven the instructions
also do not say to invert the cake on a cooling rack after about 5 minutes
cooling in the pan especially if you do not line the pan with parchment
paper if the cake cools completely in the pan and you ve only greased and
floured there is a chance that it will break apart when the pan is inverted
that said i have yet to taste the cake after it mellows for a couple weeks
i m hoping it will taste okrach

this was my first time ever baking a fruit cake and i am so glad i used this
recipeit turned out greatat first i was worried about leaving the cake
for two weeks but as it turns out fruitcake really does taste better as it
ages i decided to use this recipe to bake a cake in a 9 inch round pan so i
cut the amount of ingredients accordingly i also added more candied fruit and
put in less raisins personal preference the cake turned out moist rich 
and flavorful it was much better than anything you could buy in any bakery
just make sure you use high quality brandyyou can really taste the
difference d

fruits i used raisins dried cranberries dried cherries and apricots i love
apricots and it turned out really good this was a very rich and flavorful
cakei will make it again and will be come the aunt who brings fruit cake to
christmas

i made this cake yesterday for 16 servings i too had a problem with the
timing and such a slow oven i increased the temp towards the last 40 minutes
to 250 it took almost 2 1/2 hours to bake does anyone else think a higher
temp would have been ok with less baking time without sacrificing texture and
tastei want to make another one that s lighter in color i took the cake out
of the pan after 10 minutes of cooling and it came out perfectly loosen the
edges with a knife before removing also i wrapped mine in cheesecloth before
putting it in foil

this had way too much butterit spilled all over my oven and was a mess to
clean up you could probably use half the amount of butter and still have a
moist cake we wrapped the cakes in cheese cloth that had been dipped in rum 
then stored them in zip lock bags in a cool dark place for a month before
eating themhttps //imagesvcmeredithcorpio/v3/mm/image url https 3a 2f 2fcam image

i really like the initial flavor of the cake itself but the brandy ruined it
for me we didn t use cheap brandy the problem was that i couldn t get the
alcohol out of the cake once we added all that brandy to it over a two week
period like the recipe says i even tried baking the cake at 250 degrees for
15 minutes to bake out the alcohol that just made the edges of the cake hard
and chewy which actually wasn t terrible but it wasn t what the cake was
supposed to be like this cake is too expensive to mess up next time if
there is a next time we ll omit the two weeks of seasoning the cake with
brandy and just eat it right away the 3 stars are for the cake itself the
two remaining stars were left off b/c of the terrible alcohol taste from
adding the brandy

i made this last year for the first time and everyone loved iti am making
two fruitcakes this weekend for this holiday season my cake also baked my
cake for nearly 3 hours i made some slight adjustments i m not a huge fan
of raisins so for the 1 1/2 cups of raisins i used a mixture of raisins 
dried cherries dried blueberries and dried cranberries for the nuts i only
used pecans looking forward to making it and gifting it this holiday season

so far so goodi m not a fan of fruitcake but last year started the
tradition of making it for my father in law for christmas i used one 9x5 
loaf pan and two 5x3 pans and had the perfect amount of batter it baked
very nicely in about an hour and a half and is in the aging stage right now
seems like the perfect texture and smell for all those fruitcake lovers to
enjoy

i love fruitcake and this is the first time i ve made any i made this into 8
small cakes and one loaf size i began about a week before thanksgiving i
soaked my fruit in brandy for a couple of days then made the cakes according
to the directions i just tried one of the small cakes tonight and i am happy
with the results my cakes were sticking to the foil so i rewrapped them in
cheesecloth then foil this seems to be working better for mehttps //imagesvcmeredithcorpio/v3/mm/image url https 3a 2f 2fcam image

good tasting more like a christmas steamed pudding had to bake it at 250
for three hours i agree with the reviews that said 225 was too low and 1 hour
was too short of baking time next time i ll use less butter more like a
christmas steamed pudding sure don t have to keep soaking it with booze until
christmas like we ve done in the past will probably go back to my old recipe
next year

i followed the recipe faithfully and had enough left over to make 4 little
fruit cake muffinsthey were cooked perfectly in 1 hour but the cake took 3
hours to cook in a bundt pan very tasty i will use this recipe again but halve
the quantities also i soaked the fruit for 24 hours in brandy before making
the cake maybe that is why it took so long to cook it is so beautifully

i read the reviews before i started and seen where some thought the spices
were a little too much so i used 1 tablespoon of each of the spices and i used
dark brown sugar just because i love dark brown sugar everything else exactly
like the recipe says i used six small loaf pans and baked at 250 for 1 hour
it was absolutely outta this world i ate one by myself and my son ate one as
soon as they came outta the oven this is amazing and did i mention that i
don t like fruitcakethe other four i wrapped in cheesecloth soaked in brandy
and sealed them up in quart sized ziplock storage bags and put them in the
fridge i can t wait to test the finished productjcher

great fruitcake recipe i love the fact that no candied fruit is called for
though i did place candied cherries in the bundt before pouring the batter to
make it look more festive and i used a combo of dates raisins plums and
apricots with walnuts and pecans soaked the fruit in brandy for a couple of
hours and have been alternating brandy and amaretto to dribble over it every
day or two will be added as one of the few go to fruitcake recipes in my book
i do like fruitcake so i need more than onestellata

i was a little confused by the dried mixed fruit which can vary depending on
where you happen to be but i used raisins sultans cranberries and currents
i soak the fruit in booze over night first and wow i only tasted a small
piece but this was wonderful needed 2 hours though but i used a bundt tin
which may have made a difference thanks for sharing

this cake is toxic 2 tablespoons of nutmeg is way to much for the cake the
toxic dose of nutmeg is two to three teaspoons i assumed no one would ever
come close to that amount unintentionally until i saw report in which a couple
ate some pasta collapsed and were subsequently hospitalized it was a big
mystery until on close questioning the husband revealed that he had
accidentally added one third of a 30g spice jar of nutmeg to the meal whilst
cooking it that s about 4 teaspoons i don t know how they could have eaten
iti imagine the poor wife just trying to be politehttps //imagesvcmeredithcorpio/v3/mm/image url https 3a 2f 2fcam image

after reading others reviews about it having to cook for 3 hours i determined
the oven temp in the directions is incorrect i divided the batter into 2
bread pans and baked it at 325 for 1 hour and it came out perfect i have not
tried it because it says it has to rest for a few weeks my dad loves
fruitcake and he has never had a homemade fruitcake i m sure my dad will love
this for christmas it does smell really good i don t like fruitcakehttps //imagesvcmeredithcorpio/v3/mm/image url https 3a 2f 2fcam image

recipe is very uninteresting no big chunks of fruit or nuts the amount of
cloves pretty much guarantees it will be almost inedible because all you get
is that spice will never make this again and consider it a total waste of
some costly ingredients plus it took twice as long to cook as noted and i
think the writer must have made some errors in entering this recipe don t
waste your timehttps //imagesvcmeredithcorpio/v3/mm/image url https 3a 2f 2fcam image

this took nearly 2 hours then the firnal part of recipe did not state to
either turn upside down or leave in pan or anything just cool on wire rack
so i thought it needed to invert well it broke apart but it is delish so
next time i know to leave it in pan set at higher setting and bake for longer
than 1 hourhttps //imagesvcmeredithcorpio/v3/mm/image url https 3a 2f 2fcam image

deliciousi made this cake for my birthday and my husband and i both really
enjoyed it i used cool whip instead of whipping cream i only used real
whipping cream for the 1/4 cup you mix into the melted chocolate chips the
only thing i would change next time would be to use fewer chocolate chips it
was a bit too heavy in the stomach as is next time i d reduce the chocolate
chips to maybe 1 cup or 3/4 cup instead of 15 cups other than that a
beautiful and delicious cake i ll be making it again

deliciousi made this cake for my birthday and my husband and i both really
enjoyed it i used cool whip instead of whipping cream i only used real
whipping cream for the 1/4 cup you mix into the melted chocolate chips the
only thing i would change next time would be to use fewer chocolate chips it
was a bit too heavy in the stomach as is next time i d reduce the chocolate
chips to maybe 1 cup or 3/4 cup instead of 15 cups other than that a
beautiful and delicious cake i ll be making it againhttps //imagesvcmeredithcorpio/v3/mm/image url https 3a 2f 2fcam image

this cake was absolutely exquisite everything about this cake was delectable
i particularly enjoyed that this wonderfully chocolate cake was not too heavy
like another reviewer mentioned i recommend letting your cream warm to room
temperature before adding it to the chocolate or simply heat it in the
microwave for a few seconds to warm this will prevent the chocolate from
seizing one other note when i chilled the filling for 30 minutes it was way
too stiff to spread but maybe my refrigerator was too cold in any case i
would skip that step next time all in all this was a wonderful recipe and i
received nothing but rave reviewshttps //imagesvcmeredithcorpio/v3/mm/image url https 3a 2f 2fcam image

this is a great idea for a cake mix cake although i would suggest making the
devil s food cake mix to the specifications listed under the too much
chocolate cake recipe on this site it uses more oil and some sour cream and
insures that the cake will stay moisthazelnuts are kind of pricey and this
was a tester cake so i used toasted almonds instead for frosting i looked at
the cool whipped frosting recipe from this site but used 8 oz of fresh
cream instead of cool whip i also would recommend if using that frosting
recipe that you only use half the amount of the pudding mix and that you buy
instant white chocolate pudding rather than vanilla the vanilla gave my cake
a yellow ish tint that i did not likenext time i will use a classic white
buttercream with this cake instead

delicious cakei only had two 9 cake pans so i made a 2 instead of 3 layer
cake so the extra filling i spread on top of the cake before frosting it i
didn t have any problem with letting the filling chill completely before
spreading it as some reviewers mentioned also be aware that if you make the
frosting as written not with cool whip it won t be sweet just
creamy/nutty it can be a nice touch to offset all the sweetness of the cake
and filling but just be aware of that taste a little while you re whipping
the cream and if you don t like it as is add a pinch or two of white sugar 
until it s just sweet enough i left mine as is and feel it s a nice
contrast especially since i don t like super sweet frostings but it also
would have been good with a small pinch of sugarhttps //imagesvcmeredithcorpio/v3/mm/image url https 3a 2f 2fcam image

this was a wonderful cakewasn t too hard to make and turned out perfect the
first time instead of using the whipping cream for the topping i folded a
teaspoon of almond extract into a tub of cool whip with the chopped nuts and
it was delicious one tip is to warm the whipping cream to room temperature
before wisking it into the melted chocolate chips wisking very fast and
adding the cream very slowly this helped keep it smooth adding the cream
while it was cold made the chocolate sieze up a little and made more of a
ganache than a smooth mixture however i still crumbled it into the whipped
cream and got gooey chocolate bits inside the cream yumi almost liked
it better that way than when i got it right with the second cakebranlaadee

looking for a way to jazz up a chocolate cake mixthis was delicious
instead of using the hazelnuts whipping cream which sounds wonderful i used

this cake was fantastic and easy to makei made it for a get together with
all women you know it s good when women are having seconds and wanting to
take it homei did follow the tip about the 1/4 cup cream coming to room temp
before mixing it with the melted chocolate that helped a great deal along
with adding it slowly and whisking quickly next time i make it i think i will
use a higher grade chocolate to give the filling an even richer flavor this
recipe is a keeperdeirdre

i liked this recipe a lot when i saw it i had been searching for a hazelnut
cake recipe that i could tweak and found this one instead of adding pudding
mix i bought the chocolate cake mix with pudding added then i added about a
tbsp of hazelnut syrup didn t have extract to the cake batter chocolate
cream and frosting it was awesome everybody at the office raved about it
and the family joking said i can now open my own cake shophttps //imagesvcmeredithcorpio/v3/mm/image url https 3a 2f 2fcam image

if you really love hazelnut this is your cakei loved this cake but i think
that the icing needs a little kick i would add a little sugar or vanilla to
the whipping cream the next time the texture was really nice it tasted like
a bakery cakedeliciousi put chocolate covered hazelnuts on top of the
cake along with chocolate shavings and it was a big hittanya s

the cake and the filling were wonderfulgood taste and the cake was nice and
light i was not a fan of the whipped cream frosting though i thought it
would offset the sweetness of the rest of the cake but instead it was
tasteless and the textures didn t work well together next time i ll
experiment with a buttercream or cream cheese icing

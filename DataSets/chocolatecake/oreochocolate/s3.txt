ingredients 

this cake bakes in a 9 round springform pan with 3 sides using a springform
pan allows you to present the cake in a beautiful way you can use a 9 round
cake pan just make sure it has 3 sides

flour use all purpose or cake flour cake flour will give you a more tender crumb
sugar this cake is not overly sweet itself the oreos and chocolate drizzle on top help to sweeten it up
cocoa powder use unsweetened cocoa powder
baking powder one tablespoon might seem like a lot but it works trust memake sure to use aluminum free baking powder to prevent a metallic taste
whole milk you can use a lower fat milk but we like the higher fat milk because it makes the cake more moist
salted butter if you only have unsalted butter add a teaspoon of salt to the recipe
vanilla
eggs large eggs are standard for most recipeschocolate cake with oreos on top on a

the elf took her time perfecting her hot chocolate recipe my own recipe

overview how to make hot chocolate brownies

so what s the difference between hot chocolate brownies and regular brownieswell obviously there are the marshmallows but then there s also the increase
of cocoa powder and use of melted chocolate you really have to get the cocoa
flavor in there to mimic the wintry drink

to make hot chocolate brownies you ll need flour sugar butter eggs and
vanilla in addition to the cocoa powder chocolate and mini marshmallows melt
the chocolate and stir in the cocoa powder first so it has time to cool
slightly beat the eggs sugar and vanilla in a large bowl then whisk in the
melted chocolate finish off the batter with flour a bit of salt and
marshmallows folded in then top it off with more mini marshmallows on topphoto collage demonstrating how to make hot chocolate brownies in a mixing

how to melt chocolate

there are two ways to melt chocolate in a makeshift double boiler or in
the microwave i prefer the makeshift double boiler because i have more
control over how evenly the chocolate melts fill a medium sauce pan with
about a cup of water and bring to a simmer place a larger heat safe glass
bowl on top of the pan so it doesn t submerge into the water put chocolate
chips and butter in the glass bowl and allow them both to melt stir
occasionally and once smooth remove from heat

alternatively you can melt the chocolate and butter in the microwave place
both ingredients in a microwave safe glass bowl heat for 1 minute at 50 
power level stir and repeat in 30 second intervals at 50 power level until
chocolate is melted never add water to melted chocolate as it will seize up

can you make brownies with hot chocolate mix

yes technically you can make brownies using hot chocolate mix however hot
chocolate or hot cocoa mix contains added sugar and sometimes artificial
flavors and preservatives to keep this recipe more wholesome i chose to use
unsweetened cocoa powder instead if you do choose to use hot chocolate mix 
decrease the amount of sugar by 1/4 cup for this recipe

in my opinion unsweetened cocoa powder provides more of that cocoa taste hot
chocolate is known for this is essential in these brownies since they are
going in the ovenit s also nice to have control in how much sugar is going

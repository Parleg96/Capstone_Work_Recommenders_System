chocolatey it s a crowdpleaser and it s a classic let s all give a warm
welcome to these fudgy oreo brownies i think we re all going to be great

what are oreo browniesif you guys know anything about me it s that i am a brownie girl through and
through i love them all as you might be able to tell from the 50 recipes on
the site and these oreo brownies are definitely in my top 5 favorite
brownies of all time oreo brownies are exactly what you would imagine oreos
brownies the brownies themselves are decadent chocolatey and the texture
hits that perfect sweet spot between cakey and fudgy simply fold in some
crushed up oreo cookies and you ve instantly elevated your classic brownie to
a show stopping dessert damn they re goodbrownies with oreo pieces with a bite taken
out https //bromabakerycom/wp content/uploads/2020/04/oreo 
brownies 7jpg tips for the best oreo brownies

use high quality cocoa powder this recipe is relatively simple so the quality of your cocoa powder can really make or break your homemade brownies we love rodelle cocoa powder but any high quality cocoa powder will do the trickdon t forget vanilla i know in chocolate recipes the main focus is the chocolate ingredients like oreos cocoa powder or chocolate chips but a good vanilla extract is absolutely essential to deepening the flavor of these homemade oreo brownies
don t over bake the brownies chocolate desserts are tricky to bake perfectly because you can t go by sight when you re making a chocolate chip cookie or a vanilla cupcake you can see the baked goods turning a golden brown but with brownies there s a fine line between baked and burnt take out the brownies when a knife inserted near the edge comes out clean but a knife inserted into the middle comes out a little gooey the brownies will continue to cook as they cool and you ll be left with that perfect gooey center and a crisp crunchy edgeoverhead shot of oreo brownies https //bromabakerycom/wp

how to store oreo brownies

these oreo brownies are a great dessert to drop off for friends or mail to a
loved one because they re so fudgy that they keep moist for a decent amount of
time though i highly doubt even a crumb of these scrumptious brownies will
last longer than a few days you can always save some for later store these
in an airtight container on the counter or in the fridge for up to 1 week or
freeze for up to 3 monthshttps //bromabakerycom/wp content/uploads/2020/04/oreo brownies 6jpgfudgy brownies with oreo pieces https //bromabakerycom/wp

brownies as much as we doprint

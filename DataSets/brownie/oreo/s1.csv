use high quality cocoa powder this recipe is relatively simple so the quality of your cocoa powder can really make or break your homemade brownies we love rodelle cocoa powder but any high quality cocoa powder will do the trick,0,2,40,0,0,14,5,0,0
don t forget vanilla i know in chocolate recipes the main focus is the chocolate ingredients like oreos cocoa powder or chocolate chips but a good vanilla extract is absolutely essential to deepening the flavor of these homemade oreo brownies,1,0,40,0,0,18,5,0,0
don t over bake the brownies chocolate desserts are tricky to bake perfectly because you can t go by sight when you re making a chocolate chip cookie or a vanilla cupcake you can see the baked goods turning a golden brown but with brownies there s a fine line between baked and burnt take out the brownies when a knife inserted near the edge comes out clean but a knife inserted into the middle comes out a little gooey the brownies will continue to cook as they cool and you ll be left with that perfect gooey center and a crisp crunchy edge,0,1,104,0,0,25,23,1,0

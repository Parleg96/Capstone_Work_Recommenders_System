if it was possible to give a rating higher than 5 this cake would get iti
made this for a dessert auction at our school and it brought nearly 100every person at the table who bought it came by and literally raved about how
delicious it was it takes a long time to make but the flavors are phenomenal
and for a special occasion this is so worth it tip don t use disposable
cake pans the cake is super moist and those pans don t hold it together
quite well enough and you may find you need about a recipe and a half of the
frosting enjoyload more reviews

16 unbelievably soft sour cream cookie recipes

out on a fantastic cookie experience sour cream boasts high fat levels and a
fair amount of acidity both factors give baked goods a hefty dose of
moisture as well as a bright tangy flavor additionally sour cream does do
not thin out your batter as buttermilk or another liquid ingredient might 
which lends the baked cookies a tender fluffy texture so whether you just
need to use up some extra sour cream or want to enjoy some cookies with a
delightfully delicate crumb check out these sour cream cookie recipes and

13 great low alcoholic cocktails for day drinking

every day drinker knows the challenge of sipping when the sun s out enjoy a
couple bloody marys at 11 am and it s tough to take the rest of the day
seriously truly a boozy beverage is the bane of brunch the key to
successful day drinking then is to go low and slow choose lower alcoholic
drinks low abv cocktails and set a nice plodding pace these cocktails skip
the strong spirits instead starting with a lower alcohol base such as wine
or beer extended with non alcoholic ingredients that make the drink last
longer while they were practically designed for day drinking low alcohol
drinks are equally recommended for cocktail parties or really any time when
lucidity and dexterity are prized they ll keep you on your feet for the long
haul and of course low alcohol cocktails are also great options if you re
simply looking to cut back on your alcohol consumption without abstaining
entirely

i thought this cake was terribly dry and tasteless i will agree with one of
the other reviewers that the rum/pineapple/coconut mixture was good i made it
for the 4th of july and luckily it was just family who tried it as i honestly
would have been embarassed to serve it to guests no one wanted another piece
or to take any home so i ll end up throwing what is left away i read other
reviewers comments prior to making it so made sure i increased and made larger
holes but it still was very dry and tasteless i would recommend making more
liquid as there seems to be an insufficent amount of liquid topping for the
size of the cake if making this for company i d recommend giving it a trial
one on yourself first to be on the safe side

wow this really is a tasty cakei made this cake exactly as stated in the
recipe for a small dinner party with friends last night everyone loved ittwo words of caution 1 make sure you grease the pan thoroughly including the
top mine was so fluffy that it actually rose above the top of the pan and
stuck 2 make sure you have plenty of clearance in your oven for it to rise
i have one of those stoves with the double ovens and mistakingly used the
small one on top not a good ideawas baking bread in the big oven all in
all a winner i will definately make this againamybean

the rum/pineapple/coconut mixture was delicious but the cake unfortunately 
was not as moist as i would want i guess the sauce did not penetrate to the
bottom of the cake i would definitely make this again but maybe next time i
will poke holes in the bottom and fill the cake then after an hour turn the
cake right side up and penetrate the top of the cake with the sauce i m sure
that would be rummy and delicioussam

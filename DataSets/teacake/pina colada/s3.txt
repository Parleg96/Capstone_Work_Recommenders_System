tips and variations for making this pi a colada cake 

the batter for this cake makes six cups of batter using this pan chart 
that means you will get 2 8 round pans 2 2 9 round pans 1 2 8 
square pans 1 3 6 pans or a 7 1/2 x 3 inches bundt cake or a loaf pan
8 x4 x2 baking times may differ the cake shown was baked in 2 8 round
pans 2 deep 
16 tablespoons of butter 1 cup 2 sticks in the united states 
for my uk and australian friends confectioners sugar is icing sugar
powdered sugar 10x 
you can drizzle a little extra rum over the cake when adding the soaking
syrup 
while dried pineapple takes longer to create a filling than crushed
pineapple from a can it is more jammy and has a thicker consistency it will
also not make the cake soggy 
you can use the whisk or paddle attachment on your stand mixer 
chill the cake before frosting the cake must be completely cool before
frosting your frosting is subject to melting or clotting if your cake is not
completely cooled try sticking your cake in the freezer for 15 30 minutes
before frosting this makes the cooling process quicker 
if your cake layers are not even use a long serrated knife to even them
out 
you can frost and decorate this cake in any manner you choose 
i would not use fresh pineapple to garnish this cake 
add decorations you do not have to stick with my decorating idea for this
cake do what your creative side leads you to add candies sprinkles other
frosting flavors etc 
what decorating tip should you usefor the top of the cake a 1m tip from
wilton i went with ruffle mounds but you can do rosettes ice cream swirls 
or whatever you prefer you can also use other tips if desired 
storage store this cake in the fridge for up to five days store the cake
in an airtight container in the freezer for up to 3 months

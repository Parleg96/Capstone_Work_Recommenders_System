i was very determined to find a cheesecake recipe that had only 1 cup of sour,1,2,16,1,1,5,3,1,0
cream since that was all i had on hand i was a little skeptical about this,1,1,16,0,0,4,3,0,0
but gave it a go anyway ohmygoodness,0,1,7,0,0,1,1,0,0
it was velvety smooth creamy with,1,0,6,0,0,2,1,0,0
the perfect amount of sweetness and a hint of vanilla the shortbread cookie,1,1,13,0,0,6,0,0,0
crust is a great idea it set the cake off nicely for those of you who are,1,1,17,0,0,3,3,0,0
having problems with cracking bring your cream cheese eggs and sour cream to,1,1,13,0,0,5,3,0,0
room temp the cream cheese must be perfectly soft if you re pressed for time,1,1,15,0,0,4,4,0,0
soak the packages in warm water and squish flat until warmed through mix the,1,1,14,0,0,3,2,0,0

cheesecake is my favorite dessert so with that being said i know a good,1,2,14,0,0,3,4,0,0
cheesecake and this is really good cheescake i have my go to cheescake,1,1,13,0,0,4,3,0,0
recipe which is similiar with the ingredients just involves more bars of cc,1,1,13,0,0,4,2,0,0
the reason i made this is bc i needed to bring something to a family dinner,1,1,16,0,0,6,4,0,0
but didnt want to waist a whole cheesecake that wasnt gonna be all mine to,1,1,15,0,0,4,4,0,0
enjoy lol since i had 4 bars of cc i thought great i can make 2 one for me,1,1,19,1,2,7,3,0,0
and one to bring to the dinner which is exactly what i did,0,1,13,0,0,2,3,0,0
the only thing i,1,0,4,0,0,2,0,0,0
added was a tblsp of cornstarch tablespoon to make it thicker and creamier,1,1,13,0,0,3,3,1,0
bc i was worried that 2 bars would result in a skimpy cheescake and it came,1,1,16,1,1,4,4,0,0
out perfect and wonderful you can even do 3/4 cup sugar with this recipe and,1,1,15,1,2,3,1,1,0
it would still be delicious bc my recipe involves more bars and 3/4 cup sugar,1,1,15,1,2,4,2,1,0
and its perfectly sweet enough for those who said it was eggy,0,1,12,0,0,0,2,0,0
im confused,1,0,2,0,0,1,1,0,0
if you look at other cheescake recipes you will notice that for each bar of cc,1,1,16,0,0,4,2,0,0
is an equal amount of egg added to it so there is no reason for it to taste,1,1,18,0,0,3,4,0,0
eggy at all and mine didnt mine was perfectly sweet creamy and thick the way,1,1,15,0,0,5,2,0,0

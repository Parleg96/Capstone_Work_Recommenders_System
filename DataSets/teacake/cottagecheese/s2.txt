out on a fantastic cookie experience sour cream boasts high fat levels and a
fair amount of acidity both factors give baked goods a hefty dose of
moisture as well as a bright tangy flavor additionally sour cream does do
not thin out your batter as buttermilk or another liquid ingredient might 
which lends the baked cookies a tender fluffy texture so whether you just
need to use up some extra sour cream or want to enjoy some cookies with a
delightfully delicate crumb check out these sour cream cookie recipes and

13 great low alcoholic cocktails for day drinking

every day drinker knows the challenge of sipping when the sun s out enjoy a
couple bloody marys at 11 am and it s tough to take the rest of the day
seriously truly a boozy beverage is the bane of brunch the key to
successful day drinking then is to go low and slow choose lower alcoholic
drinks low abv cocktails and set a nice plodding pace these cocktails skip
the strong spirits instead starting with a lower alcohol base such as wine
or beer extended with non alcoholic ingredients that make the drink last
longer while they were practically designed for day drinking low alcohol
drinks are equally recommended for cocktail parties or really any time when
lucidity and dexterity are prized they ll keep you on your feet for the long
haul and of course low alcohol cocktails are also great options if you re
simply looking to cut back on your alcohol consumption without abstaining
entirely

well i also put some blueberries in the batter yum i also used one of the
premade crusts well i didn t realize that a pie crust is half the size of a

made some blueberry sauce out of a cup or two of blueberries frozen or
fresh 1/8 c sugar and about 2 tsp cornstarch heated on the stove until

this recipe doesn t taste good at allmaybe it was the frozen blueberries
the mixture of ingredients is not the consistency that cheesecake is normally
fresh blueberries might be helpful also reduce the number of eggs

as always i took some tips from other reviews and changed a few things in the
recipe first instead of gramcracker crumbs i used a whole box of minus 2 or
3 sandies shortbread cookies for the crust doubled the butter to go with
that i like thick crust i added 1/2 c frozen blueberries to the batter
with the rest of the blueberries i combined them with 1/3 c red rasberry jam
and 1/3 c sugar mix and set aside i always cook for the amount of time
suggested and then turn my oven off and let the cheese cake cool by it self in
the oven for 2 4 hours i don t get any cracks in the top of my cake that way
thank you for a differnt idea blueberries for cheesecake mrs morrison

this recipe came out greati made a couple changes though i used 1 package
regular cream cheese and 1 of low fat instead of both regular i also made a
sauce out of some extra blueberries instead of using jam the only thing is
you have to eat it within a day or 2 otherwise the blueberries get a little
funkyhttps //imagesvcmeredithcorpio/v3/mm/image url https 3a 2f 2fcam image

cracks amazing crust and followed recipe as is graham cracker crust is
baked for 10 min 350 cool before pouring in cheesecake mixture for
cooking i didn t try to wrap springform pan w/foil i put a cookie sheet with
water in it on the bottom rack and preheated to 350 same as crust turn to
250 soon as cheesecake goes in for 15 hrs turn off and leave in oven door
closed for 3 hours for slow cooling refrigerate then before serving add
blueberries i used way more than 1/3 cup jellythis is an amazingly good
recipe and 3rd time i followed above store bought quality with all organic

this came out very tasty but here are some changes i made/will make next time 
1 used 2 cups of graham crackers with correct ratio of butter and sugar it
would have been way too thin of a crust had i only done the one cup 2 will
use only 3 eggs instead of the 4 so it s less souffley 3 added a little fresh
lemon juice to batter but will add some lemon zest to add more flavor 3 
placed parchment paper at the bottom so when it cools i placed it on a plate
inside a cake cover for easy transport 4 used chilled blueberry pie
filling for the topping after it cooled in the fridge and it was quick and
yummy5 one hour baking made browning on the edges so would probably bake for
only 45 minutes next time as it is suppose to be jiggly when out of the oven
and the cooling process and chilling will settle and make it dense enjoyhttps //imagesvcmeredithcorpio/v3/mm/image url https 3a 2f 2fcam image

this is a great recipe however i made a few adjustments and it was deliciousinstead of adding two packages of regualr cream cheese i substituted one of
them with a light strawberry cream cheese i added 3 tbsp of fresh lemon
juice i added 3 eggs as apposed to 4 and i used blueberry pie filling rather
then the fresh blueberries i kept the same cooking time and let the cake cool
off in the oven for a couple hours everybody loved this recipe thankshttps //imagesvcmeredithcorpio/v3/mm/image url https 3a 2f 2fcam image

a very easy and delicious cheesecake recipei only changed 1 thing in the
recipe and that was to double the amount of jelly in order to completely cover
all of the frozen blueberries you need to seal all of the blueberriesi

i used a pre made crust so i made a half recipe which was the perfect
amount i also added blueberries to the cheese cake and made a blueberry sauce
with about 1 1/2 cups of blueberries 1/8 cup of sugar 2 tsp of corn starch
and 1 tb of water as suggested by a previous reveiw i will make this again 
but think it would benefit from some lemon or lime juice in the cheese cakehttps //imagesvcmeredithcorpio/v3/mm/image url https 3a 2f 2fcam image

this was a good cheesecake but i like the william sonoma blueberry cheese
cake a lot better it has less ingredients and tastes amazingwith this one i
don t like to use the jelly but instead i like to use only fresh berries
strawberries raspberries and blackberries are good as well the blueberries
sometimes we have a whole bunch of different berries on ours i also like to
use to use shortbread cookie crumbs instead of graham crackers it think it
just takes delicious but all in all this was a pretty good recipe i would
make it again

i did not care for this recipe i bake a lot but was in a mad rush and
couldn t find my go to recipe so i chose this one firstly the crust needs
to be baked separately for 5 mins or so otherwise it just doesn t come
together i also think the cheesecake should be baked in a water bath or

i used a pre made 10 graham cracker crust and still had batter left over to
make another pie i added fresh blueberries to the batter and used blueberry
pie filling for the topping instead of the one suggested it turned out
greatwas told it was the best blueberry cheesecake he had ever hadsuper

i hate giving negative reviews but i have to on this one it didn t have that
cheesecake taste to it like others have said it is more of a custard
resemblance it also fell and broke but maybe if adding a water tray
underneath would help i just was not impressed with this onesorrycjc

my 1st attempt at made from scratch cheesecakewonderfulafter reading
other reviews i made some changes their tips and necessity because of what i
had available to use alterations i don t own a spring pan 1 premade
graham pie crust 1 9 round cake pan with nabisco graham cracket crumbs
pressed into using pie crust recipe on box 1 8 oz regular cream cheese 1 
8 oz neufchatel low fat cream cheese 3 eggs not 4 1/4 cup sugar 1/2 cup
splenda ran out of sugar short squirt of lemon juice maybe could have used
a little bit more i also added frozen and fresh blueberries to the cheesecake
batter baked as shown but when done i shut off the oven and left it open a
little to cool them slowly no cracks in either cheesecaketried to make
blueberry topping of my ownlaked flavor but i only put it on one
cheesecake chilled in frig overnight the cheesecakes themselves however were
fantasticgreat texture and flavorhttps //imagesvcmeredithcorpio/v3/mm/image url https 3a 2f 2fcam image

i am pretty much a cheesecake novice so i am pleased to say that this turned
out exactly as advertised blueberry jelly wasn t available at my store so i
substituted blueberry jam with no added sugar this worked except that i
should have used maybe half a cup instead of a thirdhttps //imagesvcmeredithcorpio/v3/mm/image url https 3a 2f 2fcam image

followed the recipe to the t with the exception of the topping it turned out
really well so delicious mine was a bit short but it was an excellent
cheesecake i would recommend not doing a blueberry jam topping but a proper
blueberry sauce though

my family and i loved this cheesecake i followed the recipe exactly but my
spring form pan is 105 inches so i was a little short on topping i did put a
pan of water in the bottom shelf of my oven while baking no cracks at all i
will be making this many times in the future

this recipe is wonderful however it is plenty in volume for a 9x13 pan then
topped with sweetened fruit such as blueberries i discovered this when i
doubled it for a cake pan it is way to tall and hung over the edges slightly

i love this cheesecakeinstead of frozen blueberries and jelly i used
smuckers blueberry preserves i just heated it a bit on the stovetop for a
spreadable consistency as with any cheesecake you need to bake this in a
water bath to avoid cracking even if the recipe doesn t specify that

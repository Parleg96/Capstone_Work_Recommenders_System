16 unbelievably soft sour cream cookie recipes

out on a fantastic cookie experience sour cream boasts high fat levels and a
fair amount of acidity both factors give baked goods a hefty dose of
moisture as well as a bright tangy flavor additionally sour cream does do
not thin out your batter as buttermilk or another liquid ingredient might 
which lends the baked cookies a tender fluffy texture so whether you just
need to use up some extra sour cream or want to enjoy some cookies with a
delightfully delicate crumb check out these sour cream cookie recipes and

13 great low alcoholic cocktails for day drinking

every day drinker knows the challenge of sipping when the sun s out enjoy a
couple bloody marys at 11 am and it s tough to take the rest of the day
seriously truly a boozy beverage is the bane of brunch the key to
successful day drinking then is to go low and slow choose lower alcoholic
drinks low abv cocktails and set a nice plodding pace these cocktails skip
the strong spirits instead starting with a lower alcohol base such as wine
or beer extended with non alcoholic ingredients that make the drink last
longer while they were practically designed for day drinking low alcohol
drinks are equally recommended for cocktail parties or really any time when
lucidity and dexterity are prized they ll keep you on your feet for the long
haul and of course low alcohol cocktails are also great options if you re
simply looking to cut back on your alcohol consumption without abstaining
entirely

i made this for my family i put graham cracker crust instead it was super
easy just a hint for warming up the cream cheese to make it soft to work with
take the cream cheese out of the boxes leave the foil on and put in hot water
for about 10 minutes make sure the foil is sealed it warms it up then you
don t have to wait to get to room temperature it is done in a matter of
minutes i do the same with eggs as well i leave the eggs in the shell in
warm water for about 10 minutes and it does the job i will keep this recipe
for sure

pretty good cheesecake recipe my usual recipe uses more cream cheese so i
used this one i used a graham crust in a springform pan i always bake my
cheesecakes for like 15 minutes at 450 then reduce the oven temp to 250 275
and bake for like another 45min then i turn the oven off and let it cool in
there for an hour or so then place in frige overnight this way there is no
crack and it will be perfectly creamy no water bath neededif i make this
again i d probably add a tablespoon of lemon juicehttps //imagesvcmeredithcorpio/v3/mm/image url https 3a 2f 2fcam image

i ve tried this now 2 times both times i did not use the crust i used the
splendablend half sugar half splenda and low fat sour cream and low fat
cream cheese i bake it in a 9 nonstick round metal cake pan that i liberally
spray with butter flavored pam first time it cracked second time it didn t
i don t mind the cracking though because i like the rustic look doesn t look
machine made to me i baked at 325 for 70 minutes it come out to about 135
calories per serving if the cake is cut in 12 s so rich that is all i needi m thinking about serving it with berries today for color i really enjoy
this recipe thankstimpop

do not add lemon juiceit will destroy your cheesecake the thirteen people
who rated the review that suggested that as helpful obviously did not follow
the suggestion of adding lemon juice it will react badly with the sour cream
and the end result will be a mushy dense flat and acidic desert that is not
entirely unlike cheesecakehttps //imagesvcmeredithcorpio/v3/mm/image url https 3a 2f 2fcam image

i was very determined to find a cheesecake recipe that had only 1 cup of sour
cream since that was all i had on hand i was a little skeptical about this
but gave it a go anyway ohmygoodnessit was velvety smooth creamy with
the perfect amount of sweetness and a hint of vanilla the shortbread cookie
crust is a great idea it set the cake off nicely for those of you who are
having problems with cracking bring your cream cheese eggs and sour cream to
room temp the cream cheese must be perfectly soft if you re pressed for time
soak the packages in warm water and squish flat until warmed through mix the
batter as little as possible just until everything is blended i ve made this
twice now and it s perfect quick easy and simply delicioushttps //imagesvcmeredithcorpio/v3/mm/image url https 3a 2f 2fcam image

i made this for easter it went over very welli made my own crust with
graham cracker crumbs i didn t have a shortbread crust on hand i m sure that
would be even better and used low fat cream cheese that neufetchetel sp
stuff and low fat sour cream and it was still greati decorated the top
with strawberries and blueberries and my dessert was first to fly off the
table even before the double chocolate oreo cookie pienice and light after

cheesecake is my favorite dessert so with that being said i know a good
cheesecake and this is really good cheescake i have my go to cheescake
recipe which is similiar with the ingredients just involves more bars of cc
the reason i made this is bc i needed to bring something to a family dinner
but didnt want to waist a whole cheesecake that wasnt gonna be all mine to
enjoy lol since i had 4 bars of cc i thought great i can make 2 one for me
and one to bring to the dinner which is exactly what i didthe only thing i
added was a tblsp of cornstarch tablespoon to make it thicker and creamier
bc i was worried that 2 bars would result in a skimpy cheescake and it came
out perfect and wonderful you can even do 3/4 cup sugar with this recipe and
it would still be delicious bc my recipe involves more bars and 3/4 cup sugar
and its perfectly sweet enough for those who said it was eggyim confused
if you look at other cheescake recipes you will notice that for each bar of cc
is an equal amount of egg added to it so there is no reason for it to taste
eggy at all and mine didnt mine was perfectly sweet creamy and thick the way
cheesecake should be so try it and i promise you wont be dissapointed i also
used water bath on bottom shelf my cheesecakec was on middle rack and water
bath was directly underneath on bottom rack no cracks whatsoever in my
oppinion 60 min is perfect 70 will be over done mine cooked in 60 im glad i
put my timer for 60 min bc it was fully cooked

recipe is great but way too much vanilla if you are using any type of
topping half it to one teaspoon if you are otherwise perfectioni always
like the flavor of a dense cheesecake but hated how thick and dry they were
this will give you that flavor with creaminesscooked for 15 minutes at 400 
then 45 minute at 250 cracked the door to the over for an hour and then left
in the oven overnight to cool approximately 8 hours and then refrigerated

half filled with boiled water in bottom of oven while cheesecake bakes i
helps keep the oven moist cheesecake is less likely to crackgood luck

i usually seperate out 2 tbsp of sour cream and melt it with milk chocolate
chips then stir it in with the rest of the filling makes the absolute best
chocolate cheesecake especially in an oreo crusthttps //imagesvcmeredithcorpio/v3/mm/image url https 3a 2f 2fcam image

this was my first time making cheesecake and i was very pleasantly surprised
at how this recipe turned out i spent a lot of time reading the reviews and
didn t see that anyone had used greek yogurt instead of sour cream but i
opted for it anyways and it was greati cooked it for 80 minutes at 325
degrees because i put it in a roasting pan with water so it wouldn t crack 
and it didn t i also added a teaspoon of lemon juice the texture is lighter
than some of the richer cheesecakes i ve tried so i didn t feel as guilty
eating itnext time i will make with lowfat cream cheese i also wanted to
mention that i didn t have a springform pan and baked it in a non stick cake
pan instead and it was fine i was just making it for me and the husband but
it came out of the pan finehttps //imagesvcmeredithcorpio/v3/mm/image url https 3a 2f 2fcam image

i ve made this recipe numerous times in the last year and it s always been a
big hit i add two tablespoons of good rum instead of the vanilla as a nice
variation to make it quickly bake it up in foil muffin cups with a nilla
wafer on the bottom as a crust they only take about 20 minutes to bake that
way when i cook a whole cheesecake i make a graham cracker crust and put
some jam on top while it s still hot to make a glaze in either form it gets
rave reviewsi ve never used a water bath though i do bring the ingredients
up to room temp it sometimes cracks but i couldn t care less it tastes the
same either wayallrecipes member

this easy quick to put together cheese pie is a keepermade as stated but i
did add a sprinkle of cinnimon to the mixture it made too much to fit in one
pie pan so i baked 2 ramikins too i used a graham crust and added blueberry
pie filling on top when served i love to make cheese cakes but my kitchen is
very small so my springform pan is packed away this is much better then the
fluffy pies i make more like cheese cake will make this agincompany

excellenti followed this recipe to the t i left the cream cheese on the
counter to soften to room temperature it baked perfectly in 56 minutes
without a single crack i let it cool on a rack on the counter for about 3

i had to use up some sour cream and cream cheese before it went bad in my frig
and i found this recipe i didn t have a cheesecake pan so i had to use two
pie pans the batter was too much for one pie pan i made a homemade graham
cracker crust because i didn t have the shortbread the cheesecake was
alright i thought it would be better with all these good reviews i will just
stick with an original new york style cheesecake next time

i make this recipe without a crust and substituting a sweetener for the white
suger to make it a low carb treat it has become my go to recipe i have
made it many times now i like it with a dollop of no sugar added jam on top
i have found that the longer you beat the cream cheese and egg mixture the
fluffier it will be when baked it really is a great base to experiment with
add ins as well try peanut butter and/or chocolate chips yumit is a
perfectly simple and very tasty reciperocksgirl

this was the first time i made cheesecake and it was a hiti combed through
my pantry and combined shortbread and graham crackers to make the crust from
scratch since i only had 8 ozs of cream cheese i adjusted the rest of the
ingredients accordingly 1/2 of sugar eggs vanilla and sour cream the
result was a lighter cheesecake for the topping i warmed up frozen mixed
berries on the saucepan and did not add sugar and then spooned on top of the
cheesecake will definitely follow the recipe next time and will probably come
out with a richer cheesecake never knew making cheesecake was easy and will
never buy a store bought one againhttps //imagesvcmeredithcorpio/v3/mm/image url https 3a 2f 2fcam image

i just made this cheesecake last night what an excellent flavorthe sour
cream gave it a nice tang the texture was smooth and creamy not at all like
a traditional ny style cheesecake i thought it baked up very firm but was
disappointed that it cracked a great deal while baking it also fell about a
half inch as it cooled i tried it topped with blackberry syrup yummymcsetter

wow this was easy i wasn t concerned with cracking as it typically doesn t
take away from the taste so i beat the living daylights out of the cream
cheese eggs and sour cream i did grease the sides of my pan placed a cake
pan full of boiling water on the other rack in the oven and made a tinfoil
tent over the cake itself i didn t want that chewy film you can sometimes
getthought the tinfoil would help not only did it not crack but it tasted
amazingtip do let it sit overnight in the fridge i tried a piece a couple
hours after cooling and wasn t over the moon this morning hey don t judge 
if there s cheesecake in the fridge it s just as much a breakfast dish as it
is a dessert the cake was superbi didn t use the crust recipe i mixed a
cup of chocolate crumbs with crushed walnuts and butter yummycreamy smooth
and impressivewill be making this one a loti also liked that it only used
2 packages of cream cheese that stuff is starting to resemble the price of
gold per ouncehttps //imagesvcmeredithcorpio/v3/mm/image url https 3a 2f 2fcam image

not your normal dense cheescake you could eat more than one piece without
feeling too full nice and light make sure it is completely cool before you
eat it i cut it too close to serving time and it was a little warm still it
was a lot better later after it was in the refrig for a couple of hours

i made this for christmas dinner today it was wonderfully deliciousi
creamed the cream cheese and sugar for a long time in my standing mixer about
5 min on med/high speed it made it very light and fluffy i thought perfect
i seemed to have an abundance left over after filling the pie shell so not
sure if that was from creaming it so long or what but i could almost have made
two wonderful pies in fact i could have had i not overfilled the first one a
little i cooked it for 70 min it did crack a little but it was toasty brown
on top and cooled and settled beautifully i was impressed with my first
attempt a cheesecake it was a hit and so yummythanks for the recipe i
will make two next time out of this recipe and maybe try the graham cracker
crust with one

i made this recipe twice with great results the first time i used low fat
sour cream no lemon juice and used the water bath cooking method the result
was great tasting with no cracks but it wasn t quite set completely i think
the lemon juice would have done the trick second time i used regular sour
cream 1 tablespoon of lemon juice and the modified heat cooking method and
got great results without a crack also either way it s got our votehttps //imagesvcmeredithcorpio/v3/mm/image url https 3a 2f 2fcam image

i usually use chantal s new york cheesecake from this site but only had two
tubs of cream cheese and very little time so i made this one simple and easy
my husband loved it so i ll make this again for sure i baked this in a 9 inch
pie pan and just pressed ground up shortbread cookies with melted butter into
the pan and then poured the filling in 60 minutes later it was golden brown
with a few cracks but topped it with raspberry sauce and it was delicious
recommend if needing a quick cheesecake

this turned out great the sour cream makes it creamier and not as firm as
other cheesecakes i made my own graham cracker crust and i added juice of one
lime along with 1 teaspoon of lime zest i prefer a citrus flavored
cheesecake i also topped it with a homemade strawberry sauce i also used a
bath and it didn t crack my wife and daughter just ate cheesecake at the

this is an awesome recipe i never thought i would be able to make a cheese
cake this good the only thing i would add is that it is almost a must that
your cream cheese is at room temperature if you fail to leave it out long
enough put it in the microwave for 45 sec to 1 minute of course take it out
of the foil packaging first oh and it does crack but i don t mind because i
always top it with fruit thanks for sharing this recipe

now this is what cheesecake is supposed to taste likethis was awesomei
used a 9 inch graham cracker crust but there was a tad too much batter for the
crust i cooked it in a water bath for 80 minutes and it came out flawless
thanks for the great recipehttps //imagesvcmeredithcorpio/v3/mm/image url https 3a 2f 2fcam image

i ve made this recipe for my husband several times and it never lasts longer
than a daymaybe my shortbread crust tins are small but it produces about a
cup more filling than needed other than that this recipe is perfectkerman

very good fits nicely in my heart shaped pie plate if you make a half recipe
very easy to halve the ingredientshttps //imagesvcmeredithcorpio/v3/mm/image url https 3a 2f 2fcam image

the taste of the cheesecake was great unfortenatly living in australia i was
unable to get graham crackers for a crust and the biscuts i used did not bind
well with the butter the crust crumbled at touch did add cinnamon and nutmeg
to the crust which helped with the taste everyone who ate it gave rave
reviews said it was awesome i will be using this as my go to cheesecake
recipe in the future

going to try it again sometime and i ll post another review i did it without
a crust but i may do the shortbread crust with chocolate chips on it sounds

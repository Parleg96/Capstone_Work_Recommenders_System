a black and white poured fondant type frosting and everyone enjoyed it so
simple to make and a definite keeper

this recipe is simple to make because there are only six ingredients and easy
to follow instructions it is delicious to eat anytime for a snack or dessert
after a meal it is almost impossible to make a mistake because the
instructions are written perfectly in fact the recipe is easy to memorize
and there is no need to read it every time you bake

i love a cake with a crusty crusti love eating hard crunchy food it really
was delightfully sweet and browned up nicely it had the sweet spongy texture
of a store bought pound cake but with tons more of crunchnot sure why but
it made 3 cakes instead of 2 maybe i didn t fill the pans enoughthe batter
was thick so perhaps i should have pushed it in moreanyway since i had a
3rd cake i added some lemon zest and sour cream and it is nice i think the
cream cheese was the key ingredient to the moistness of this cakefabulousadvertisement

the recipe is right as written such as the salt and no leavening i ve made
this cake for many years and worked fine until i moved to high elevation i
now live at 5 000 ft elevation and had to adjust accordingly such as less
sugar more vanilla and flour don t over beat the batter too much air in the
batter in high altitude is not good raise the temp to 375 just for
preheating then turn down to 350 for the baking time check after 50 minutes

i made this cake way too sweet although i ve reduce the sugar 1/2 cup i
suggest maybe the sugar should be cut down to 2 cup only and add 1 tbsp or
more of lemon juice to make it balancebut the cake has a unique texture it s
crumbly but it s buttery and also the skin of the cake is incredibly crisp and
sweet

this cake was great and i mean greati thought i had two loaf pans when at
the last minute i realized i didn t i used the bundt pan as suggested and did
cook it for the longer end of the cooking time i didn t make any changes to
the recipe and it was fantastic one would think that a cream cheese pound
cake wouldn t need any gilding but i added mascereated strawberries with a
splash of balsamic and some fresh whipped cream and it was a hit i ve already
had recipe requests ty msmartha stewart member

i have not made this yet but shouldn t this recipe have some leavening in it
maybe 2 tsp baking powderotherwise i expect it would be very dense and
therefore take a very long time to bake at a lower temperature

this recipe looks good and the batter even tastes goodbut after baking it
had a strong egg taste to it kind of like a custard it was not good at

pretty the texture is good it even flipped pretty well not sure what i am
going to do with itperhaps throw it out

i m an experienced cook and have baked hundreds of cakes in my life and this
recipe was a real disappointment i followed the instructions exactly to the
tee but the end result was two cakes that were mushy in the middle and hard
on the outside top bottom and sides i used one aluminum pan and one pyrex 
tested with a toothpick and tented the tops when golden despite this i got
the same poor result for both

this is a foolproof recipe i have had this recipe passed down in my family
for years and it is always a favoritechange the extract to produce your
favorite flavor of pound cake or add nuts just remember to add about 15
minutes to the cooking time if you add nuts i cook this cake at 300 degrees
for 1 hr 30 minutes in a tube pan

this particular tea cake is also referred to as an irish sponge cake and,1,0,14,0,0,4,2,0,0

cake is to make it makes for an easy birthday cake or holiday dessert,2,1,14,0,0,4,3,0,0
the cake is very light and delicately sweet which is probably why it shows up,1,2,15,0,0,2,3,0,0
at tea time so as not to overpower the enjoyment of a proper irish tea,1,1,15,0,0,3,1,0,0

what makes an irish tea cake so tasty,0,2,8,0,0,2,1,0,0
the cake is easy to make i mean super super easy,1,0,11,0,0,3,2,0,0
not overly sweet this cake has a nice balance of sweetness and vanilla flavor,1,1,14,0,0,5,2,0,0

tips for making an irish tea cake,2,2,7,0,0,3,1,0,0
bring the refrigerated ingredients to room temperature ingredients incorporate and bake better when they are all start at the same temperature,1,2,21,0,0,7,3,0,0
add the eggs one at time this is just good practice to make sure the eggs are fully incorporated,1,1,19,0,0,3,5,0,0
alternate adding flour and milk this allows for proper absorption of the liquid ingredients without causing the batter to separate,1,1,20,0,0,7,4,0,0
don t overmix a general rule of thumb for baking with flour we don t want to overmix the batter and end up with a chewy cake,1,1,27,0,0,8,5,0,0
get creative with toppings the cake is so versatile in flavor and texture it can take on any topping frosting or fruit not to mention it is still delicious without all of that,0,1,33,0,0,6,6,0,0

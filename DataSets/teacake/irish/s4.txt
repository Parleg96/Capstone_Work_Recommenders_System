traditional irish dessert

the history of this irish tea cake is a little a little varied if you
look up irish tea cake chances are you will come across recipes similar to
this one as well as recipes for a tea cake called a barmbrack i will
save the history lesson on the barmbrack for another day perhaps when i
actually bake itthis particular tea cake is also referred to as an irish sponge cake and
it is a dessert that may not only be served at tea time given how simple the
cake is to make it makes for an easy birthday cake or holiday dessert

the cake is very light and delicately sweet which is probably why it shows up
at tea time so as not to overpower the enjoyment of a proper irish tea
this also makes the cake a great canvas to sprinkle with powdered sugar or
serve it a bit more fancy as a layer cake with fruit and whipped cream 

what is the difference between an irish tea cake and an american cakemy opinion an american sponge cake has more sugar and butter not a bad
thing but there may be times when you just want a simple and lightly
sweetened cakeslice of tea cake on a
plate data image/svg xml 3csvg 20xmlns http //wwww3org/2000/svg 20viewbox 0 200 20900 201200 3e 3c/svg 3eslice

st patrick s day dessert

how about a delicious irish dessert recipe without alcoholeven though
there are some tasty irish beverages that you can sneak into your desserts a
stout cake or bailey s brownies take it from a fellow irish lass not
every st patrick s day dessert needs to have booze

or maybe they dobut for the sake of keeping things tea time proper this recipe for
irish tea cake will have your reaching for a cup of irish breakfast
tea rather than a pint of irish guinness 

what makes an irish tea cake so tastythe cake is easy to make i mean super super easy
not overly sweet this cake has a nice balance of sweetness and vanilla flavor 
it is moist we are adding a lot of good fat to this recipe to keep the cake moist and tender like all of my favorite ingredients for cake butter milk and sour cream
versatility the cake is delicious with a simple dusting of powdered sugar or make it a fancy layer cake with whipped cream and berries

tips for making an irish tea cake

bring the refrigerated ingredients to room temperature ingredients incorporate and bake better when they are all start at the same temperature
add the eggs one at time this is just good practice to make sure the eggs are fully incorporated
alternate adding flour and milk this allows for proper absorption of the liquid ingredients without causing the batter to separate
don t overmix a general rule of thumb for baking with flour we don t want to overmix the batter and end up with a chewy cake
get creative with toppings the cake is so versatile in flavor and texture it can take on any topping frosting or fruit not to mention it is still delicious without all of thathappy st patrick s day friendsmore cake recipes

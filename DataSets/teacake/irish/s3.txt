16 unbelievably soft sour cream cookie recipes

out on a fantastic cookie experience sour cream boasts high fat levels and a
fair amount of acidity both factors give baked goods a hefty dose of
moisture as well as a bright tangy flavor additionally sour cream does do
not thin out your batter as buttermilk or another liquid ingredient might 
which lends the baked cookies a tender fluffy texture so whether you just
need to use up some extra sour cream or want to enjoy some cookies with a
delightfully delicate crumb check out these sour cream cookie recipes and

13 great low alcoholic cocktails for day drinking

every day drinker knows the challenge of sipping when the sun s out enjoy a
couple bloody marys at 11 am and it s tough to take the rest of the day
seriously truly a boozy beverage is the bane of brunch the key to
successful day drinking then is to go low and slow choose lower alcoholic
drinks low abv cocktails and set a nice plodding pace these cocktails skip
the strong spirits instead starting with a lower alcohol base such as wine
or beer extended with non alcoholic ingredients that make the drink last
longer while they were practically designed for day drinking low alcohol
drinks are equally recommended for cocktail parties or really any time when
lucidity and dexterity are prized they ll keep you on your feet for the long
haul and of course low alcohol cocktails are also great options if you re
simply looking to cut back on your alcohol consumption without abstaining
entirely

very good cakeeveryone thought it was shortcake for the strawberries we
were in a hurry we used an electric mixer and the cake was done within an
hour we doubled the recipe and used two nonstick pans one greased with pam 
one ungreased only the one in the greased pan came out cleanly make sure
your pans are very well greased

loved itsimilar to a sponge or crumb cake delicious even using margarine
instead of butter make sure to beat the sugar/butter or margarine for a
long time to incorporate air it makes the cake come out light and fluffy do
not beat to much after adding flour though added only 1 tb more milk my
husband said he couldn t stop eating it it is plenty sweet sweetness just
right baked it in a sprayed 8 sq glass pan still gooey at 30 mins so i
baked it 10 mins more 40 mins total will make this againejlown

this is a wonderful recipe it makes a nice sized cake for snacking or a small
party it isn t too sweet which is wonderful for tea coffee its texture is
similar to pound cake but i wouldn t go so far as to state that it s very
dry dense just a slightly heavier texture than your standard cake i
imagine it would turn out badly if it were overmixed i stirred in the flour
milk by hand so that wouldn t happenhttps //imagesvcmeredithcorpio/v3/mm/image url https 3a 2f 2fcam image

excellent st patty s day finishthis cake was moist delicious and stayed
that way for a few days just sweet enough to enhance your tea and leave a
nice aftertaste before sprinkling on the confectioner s sugar my wife put a
little cinnamon sugar on topi recommend this one and we ll be making it
again if you re adventurous poke some holes in the top of your slice with
toothpicks and then douse it with some bailey s irish creamit will soak
right into the holes ohhh yummmmmayykrystenl

this was very tasty although a tad bit dry i topped it with sliced
strawberries and chocolate sauce i think the dryness of the cake is not
necessarily a downfall as it will stand up wonderfully under juicy fruits or
sauces without becoming soggy will make again for sure

i was intrigued by half the reviews here which said moist and the other
half which said dry so i tried it myselfit is a dense and fairly dry
cake i would say there is plenty of butter so it is a pleasure to eat and
plenty sweet for an afternoon snack but moist or poundcake like i would
not agree it is a sturdy tasty cake and so easy to make i will definitely
use this recipe again would be especially nice with some strawberries and
whipped cream in the summerhttps //imagesvcmeredithcorpio/v3/mm/image url https 3a 2f 2fcam image

the perfect cake to serve after dinner with a scoop of ice cream and a cup of
tea would also be good with a citrus glaze pour over top

this is an awesome cake plain with vanilla ice cream is how we tried it out 
but i m looking forward to drown it in irish creami actually replaced baking
powder with baking soda purely by mistake and it still survived the roommate
review boardthat was when it was drowned in ice cream i don t advise the
sodai hope to make it the right way next timehttps //imagesvcmeredithcorpio/v3/mm/image url https 3a 2f 2fcam image

just back from a st patrick s potluck where i brought this cake great success
and yes it was moist enough for the party s tastefollowing all the
advices i did double the milk quantity i also choose to stick with the
vanilla flavor but shall definitively try next time with the almond flavor 
now to make it really irish i had added in the dough 1/2 cup of whisky and
some candied green cherries

wowi don t know what i did wrong i doubled the recipe to make a 9x13 cake
but the middle fell completely it was done around the edges and raw in the
middle i was excited about making a cake from scratch but it ended up a
complete waste of ingredients to make myself feel better i baked a box cake
and it turned out fine i am wondering if it had something to do with being at
a high altitude any suggestions out thereallrecipes member

great recipei made this for st patrick s day this year and served it with
sweet cream and strawberries best cake i ve madei had some egg whites left
over from making mousse and didn t want to just toss the perfectly good egg
whites so i whipped to them into soft peaks and folded them into the batter
i noticed some reviewers commenting that they had found the cake heavy or
dense try folding in some soft peak whipped egg whites end result was light
and spongy perfectweekendcooker

easy to make however it didn t taste as good as we thought it would we
substituted oil for the butter and that might be what made it taste not so
good and yes everyone is right use wax paper with oil spray or parchment
paper on the pan because it does stick even on a non stick pan we iced ours
with 2 cups of confectioners sugar and the juice of two limes which i think
helped with the overall taste of the cake next time i think i will do what
another reviewer did and use strawberry jam inbetween layers

with parchment i mixed the wet ingredients well but only lightly combined
the dry with the wet and the cake came out very moist and not too heavy or

this cake is understated in its simplicity but sometimes a nice simple cake
is all that you need this recipe is not too sweet and had a nice delicate
crumb i ran out of all purpose flour and used cake and pastry flour for half
of my flour content once this was served i found it difficult to stop
eating especially when i added whipped cream and strawberries to it i m
not sure how irish this recipe is but it s certainly one that i m keepinga great addition to our st patrick s day menu at my househttps //imagesvcmeredithcorpio/v3/mm/image url https 3a 2f 2fcam image

this was a really good cake i do think i would cut the sugar down to 3/4 of a
cup as it was really sweet and like a lot of cakes i liked it better the next
day i was not sure just how the cake was going to turn out but would put it
closer to a pound cake type of cake i will make this again and again as it
was very easy and had a good taste

first made to the recipe exactly this was a great tea cake flavor wise we
did think that it was a bit dry which does go well drinking a cup of earl
greyi next made it and split the cake and using a string cut the cake into
two layers i spread raspberry preserves between the two layers and topped
with whipped cream as soon as i can find some clotted cream we are going to
try it with a lemon curd filling and clotted cream on the top updated i made
this recipe again for a very large family dinner splitting the cakes in two
with a length of string as before on the first cake i used lemon curd for
filling with a clotted cream dollop for each slice the second cake i filled
with fresh sliced strawberries mixed with a bit of freshly whipped cream
which i had slightly sweetened with raw sugar i garnished that cake with
whipped cream and whole strawberries on the top both went over very well now
i just need to figure out something for the chocoholicssalina

the flavor is wonderful and it is a nice firm cake a bit too crumbly for me 
but i will make it again and try adding even more milk to the batter overall 
this was enjoyable with a hot cup of coffee i added extra vanilla to mask the
cornbread taste which some cakes have

very goodit tastes so buttery i did change the recipe a bit by adding the
full cup of milk as others recommended i only added it because the batter was
too doughy like cookie dough rather than cake batter i was afraid it would
be way too dry for the 40 minute cooking time anyway the cake came out
perfect very tender spongy but compact it cooked for about 33 minutes i
lined my pan with wax paper and oiled it a bit the cake slid right off and no
clean up necessary we had it plain but i think strawberries with sugar would
make it even nicer

s mores brownies on the blog and guess which recipe wonthat s right oreobut guess whats mores only lost by 3so i ve decided

ingredients for oreo fudge brownies 

butter i always suggest using unsalted butter but salted will work in a pinch simply omit the salt called for in the recipe
sugar granulated sugar works best for these brownies if you only have brown sugar and are dying to bake these it will work but because brown sugar contains more moisture than granulated the brownies will be slightly more cakey
oil liquified coconut oil vegetable oil and canola oil are all great options i don t suggest olive oil because it will add an aftertaste i don t find particularly desirable at least not in browniesvanilla extract just a dash enhances all of the flavors if you re out don t fretyou can simply omit this ingredient and bake as directed
eggs make sure you have large eggs not medium or extra large and bring them to room temperature before you begin bakingflour all purpose flour measured the right waywhich is by fluffing the flour up in the bag then lightly spooning the flour into the measuring cup fill the cup up until it s heaping over then use the flat edge of a knife to level it off measure your cocoa powder the same wayor use an electric scalecocoa powder because this recipe doesn t call for baking soda or baking powder you can use dutch process cocoa powder or unsweetened cocoa powder i prefer dutch process because it gives the brownies a rich cocoa flavor and colorsalt don t skip the saltjust a dash balances out the sweetness and enhances the chocolate flavororeo cookies you ll need 14 oreo cookies for this recipei like to just roughly break them up with my hands you ll fold half into the batter and then press the other half on top of the brownie batter
chocolate chips i like to add between a 1/2 cup to 1 cup you can use any variety of chocolate chips but i prefer semi sweet or dark chocolate note using white chocolate chips or milk chocolate chips will make these brownies much sweeter you can omit the chocolate chips all together but the tops of the brownies may be a little less shiny

please see the recipe box for exact quantitiesthe above is simply a more in 
depth look at the ingredients needed as well as suggestions for
substitutionsoreo brownies are so easy and a million times more delicious than boxed

tips for baking perfect brownies

1 use the right baking pani suggest using a reflective metal baking pan like this one
2 if you re using a glass or ceramic baking pan you ll need to increase the bake time by about 10 minutes
3 be sure your eggs are a room temperaturethis will ensure your ingredients properly bond together and that your eggs don t scramble when they re combined with the hot butter
4 don t over mix your brownie batterthis is what causes cakey brownies
5 pro tip stop mixing when you still see the tiniest trace of dry ingredients then fold in your chocolate chips and oreo cookies you should only need 3 or 4 stirs to incorporate those final ingredients it s better to under mix than over mix6 bake your brownies on the middle rack i get a lot of questions about this so just wanted to point out that unless otherwise stated i always suggest baking on the middle rack
7 you ll also want to be sure not to over bake your oreo browniesthey should still be a little jiggly in the center and a few moist crumbs will come out when a toothpick is inserted
8 place your brownies on a cooling rack and cool completely in the panyou ll be amazed at how much they firm up as they cool
9 if you want a warm and gooey brownie simply reheat in the microwave for a few secondsoreo brownie batter in pan https //bakerbynaturecom/wp 
content/uploads/2020/04/oreo brownies 1 of 1 1jpg 

can i freeze browniesyesi freeze these all the time i like to individually wrap each brownie 
then pop them in a large freezer bag and place that in the freezer

they ll keep for 2 monthsbut they never last that long in my house lol to
thaw simply place it on the counter for a few hours or if you really can t
wait unwrap and microwave for a few secondsoreo brownies are so easy and a million times more delicious than boxed

these were super easy to make and so fudgymy idea of a perfect brownie is
that dense fudgy slightly underbaked chocolate goodness and these fit that
bill perfectlyalso love that the recipe is given in both cups and grams
since i will pretty much only bake by weight now easier and much more
accurate will definitely make these againreply

anyone else who gives it a go keep an eye on them as i guess it all depends on
the oven

hithanks for the tipit definitely sounds like your oven may run hot so i
would suggest always checking your baked goods 10 minutes earlier than the
estimated bake time

the best brownieshaven t even finished the first batch and already making
another pan for reference i only have an 8 8 glass pan so added 10 min to
bake time as the recipe suggests for baking in glass and additional 5 for the
smaller pan size and they were perfectyou definitely do have to let them
cool for a couple of hours as the recipe suggests so they set properly in the
middle which is really hard but ultimately so worth itreply

these are soo deliciousi love the slight crunch from the combination of the
edge of the brownie and the oreos but the inside is still perfectly fudgy
this was my first time baking brownies from scratch and after this won t be
my lastreply

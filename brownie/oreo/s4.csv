brownies 1234 1 of 1jpg,2,1,5,1,6,1,0,0,0
ingredients for oreo fudge brownies,2,2,5,0,0,4,0,0,0
butter i always suggest using unsalted butter but salted will work in a pinch simply omit the salt called for in the recipe,1,2,23,0,0,6,6,1,0
sugar granulated sugar works best for these brownies if you only have brown sugar and are dying to bake these it will work but because brown sugar contains more moisture than granulated the brownies will be slightly more cakey,1,1,39,0,0,8,10,0,0
oil liquified coconut oil vegetable oil and canola oil are all great options i don t suggest olive oil because it will add an aftertaste i don t find particularly desirable at least not in brownies,0,1,36,0,0,11,8,0,0
vanilla extract just a dash enhances all of the flavors if you re out don t fret,0,0,17,0,0,6,1,0,0
you can simply omit this ingredient and bake as directed,1,0,10,0,0,2,1,0,0
eggs make sure you have large eggs not medium or extra large and bring them to room temperature before you begin baking,0,1,22,0,0,4,7,1,0
flour all purpose flour measured the right way,0,0,8,0,0,3,2,0,0
which is by fluffing the flour up in the bag then lightly spooning the flour into the measuring cup fill the cup up until it s heaping over then use the flat edge of a knife to level it off measure your cocoa powder the same way,0,0,47,0,0,9,10,1,0
or use an electric scale,0,0,5,0,0,1,1,0,0
cocoa powder because this recipe doesn t call for baking soda or baking powder you can use dutch process cocoa powder or unsweetened cocoa powder i prefer dutch process because it gives the brownies a rich cocoa flavor and color,0,0,40,0,0,17,7,0,0
salt don t skip the salt,0,0,6,0,0,4,1,0,0
just a dash balances out the sweetness and enhances the chocolate flavor,0,0,12,0,0,4,2,0,0
oreo cookies you ll need 14 oreo cookies for this recipe,0,0,11,1,2,4,2,0,0
i like to just roughly break them up with my hands you ll fold half into the batter and then press the other half on top of the brownie batter,1,0,30,0,0,8,4,0,0
chocolate chips i like to add between a 1/2 cup to 1 cup you can use any variety of chocolate chips but i prefer semi sweet or dark chocolate note using white chocolate chips or milk chocolate chips will make these brownies much sweeter you can omit the chocolate chips all together but the tops of the brownies may be a little less shiny,2,1,64,1,3,19,8,1,0

tips for baking perfect brownies,2,2,5,0,0,2,1,0,0
1 use the right baking pan,0,2,6,1,1,3,1,0,0
i suggest using a reflective metal baking pan like this one,1,0,11,0,0,4,3,0,0
2 if you re using a glass or ceramic baking pan you ll need to increase the bake time by about 10 minutes,1,1,23,1,3,5,5,0,0
3 be sure your eggs are a room temperature,0,1,9,1,1,3,2,0,0
this will ensure your ingredients properly bond together and that your eggs don t scramble when they re combined with the hot butter,1,0,23,0,0,5,4,0,0
4 don t over mix your brownie batter,0,1,8,1,1,3,0,0,0
this is what causes cakey brownies,1,0,6,0,0,1,2,0,0
5 pro tip stop mixing when you still see the tiniest trace of dry ingredients then fold in your chocolate chips and oreo cookies you should only need 3 or 4 stirs to incorporate those final ingredients it s better to under mix than over mix,0,1,46,1,3,11,5,0,0
6 bake your brownies on the middle rack i get a lot of questions about this so just wanted to point out that unless otherwise stated i always suggest baking on the middle rack,1,0,34,1,1,7,7,0,0
7 you ll also want to be sure not to over bake your oreo brownies,0,1,15,1,1,2,4,0,0
they should still be a little jiggly in the center and a few moist crumbs will come out when a toothpick is inserted,1,0,23,0,0,5,4,0,0
8 place your brownies on a cooling rack and cool completely in the pan,0,1,14,1,1,6,0,0,0
you ll be amazed at how much they firm up as they cool,1,0,13,0,0,0,5,0,0
9 if you want a warm and gooey brownie simply reheat in the microwave for a few seconds,0,1,18,1,1,5,2,0,0

can i freeze brownies,0,2,4,0,0,2,1,0,0
yes,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0
i freeze these all the time i like to individually wrap each brownie,1,0,13,0,0,5,1,0,0
then pop them in a large freezer bag and place that in the freezer,2,1,14,0,0,4,1,0,0
they ll keep for 2 months,0,2,6,1,1,1,2,0,0
but they never last that long in my house lol to,1,0,11,0,0,2,0,0,0
thaw simply place it on the counter for a few hours or if you really can t,1,1,17,0,0,3,2,0,0

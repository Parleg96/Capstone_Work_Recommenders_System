i mentioned a couple weeks ago that i d be bringing you some new basic
favorites and i started with my easy moist chocolate cake today we are
talking about these moist vanilla cupcakes and i m pumpedone of the things
that i m always messing with is vanilla cake/cupcakes it s the never ending
quest for all the best versions i m a believer that if you don t have a good
vanilla cake you have nothingok dramatic but it s like the tell if
you don t have a good vanilla can anything else really be that goodthere
are so many ways to vary a vanilla cake and i want the best of all of themi m greedy like that plus i know not every has the same idea of the perfect
cupcake so i like to have options

you may or may not have tried my original vanilla cupcakes they are loved by
many and were my favorite for some time i still remember the batches upon
batches of cupcakes i made while testing those and the fabulous friends that
lined them up and tasted tested them all to help me find the best one if you
haven t tried them they are worth checking out but while i still love them 
these are my new fave sorry og cupcake there s a new star in townbest moist vanilla cupcakes https //wwwlifeloveandsugarcom/wp

so let s talk a bit about these cupcake there s no need for creaming to get
involved which is kind of a plus creaming butter and sugar together makes
quite a fabulous cupcake but sometimes you just want quick and easy and to
barely even need to use a mixer i mean basically like a box mix but not you
knowthese are those cupcakes the og cupcake was that way too but used
butter and were a little denser these cupcakes use oil and are lighter

we ve got the usual suspects in this cupcake starting with the dry
ingredients all purpose flour sugar baking powder and salt easy common
ingredients that you should totally have in your pantry already mix em all
together and set em aside

next are the wet ingredients milk vegetable oil vanilla extract and eggs
the oil is the fat component instead of butter and in my opinion tends to
make a more moist cake that stays moist for longer totally true for these
cupcakes the milk i typically use 2 adds to the structure of the cake in
addition to adding moisture milk adds fluff and i love some fluff i used a
full tablespoon of vanilla extract to make sure there s plenty of delicious
vanilla flavor then the eggs add more moisture structure and flavor i
switched it up in these and went with whole eggs instead of egg whites no
more egg yolks getting wasted hereonce the wet and dry ingredients are combined the water is added

there s so much moisture in these cupcakesi love themi m a big big fan of
their ease of making their flavor and moisture they use such simple
ingredients that you likely already have in your pantry too scorewhen
topped with my favorite vanilla buttercream these vanilla cupcakes really are
a dreamthey were a big hit in our house and i hope you love them as much as
we didhomemade moist vanilla cupcakes https //wwwlifeloveandsugarcom/wp

that i cannot recreate if you d prefer a more traditional vanilla cupcake
that uses butter and a little bit of oil as well as the creaming method and
seems to be less finicky for people try out these easy homemade vanilla
cupcakes they are currently my favorite vanilla cupcake

this is more of a light sponge cake texture the icing makes it because it
would be pretty bland without i reduced water by 1/2 cup and still had batter
i put in a small individual loaf pan and correct to say it s easy due to
ingredients on hand i didn t have any sour cream on hand for a more decadent
cake like cupcake

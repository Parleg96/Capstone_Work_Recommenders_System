i mentioned a couple weeks ago that i d be bringing you some new basic,1,2,15,0,0,4,4,0,0
favorites and i started with my easy moist chocolate cake today we are,1,1,13,0,0,5,2,0,0
talking about these moist vanilla cupcakes and i m pumped,0,1,10,0,0,3,2,1,0
one of the things,1,0,4,0,0,1,0,0,0
that i m always messing with is vanilla cake/cupcakes it s the never ending,1,1,14,0,0,1,5,1,0
quest for all the best versions i m a believer that if you don t have a good,1,1,18,0,0,3,4,0,0
vanilla cake you have nothing,0,1,5,0,0,3,1,0,0
ok dramatic but it s like the tell if,1,0,9,0,0,1,1,0,0
you don t have a good vanilla can anything else really be that good,0,1,14,0,0,3,3,0,0
there,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
are so many ways to vary a vanilla cake and i want the best of all of them,0,1,18,0,0,4,3,0,0
i m greedy like that plus i know not every has the same idea of the perfect,1,0,17,0,0,3,4,0,0
cupcake so i like to have options,2,1,7,0,0,2,1,1,0
you may or may not have tried my original vanilla cupcakes they are loved by,1,2,15,0,0,2,4,1,0
many and were my favorite for some time i still remember the batches upon,1,1,14,0,0,3,2,0,0
batches of cupcakes i made while testing those and the fabulous friends that,1,1,13,0,0,4,2,1,0
lined them up and tasted tested them all to help me find the best one if you,1,1,17,0,0,0,5,0,0
haven t tried them they are worth checking out but while i still love them,1,1,15,0,0,2,4,0,0
these are my new fave sorry og cupcake there s a new star in town,0,1,15,0,0,3,3,1,0

so let s talk a bit about these cupcake there s no need for creaming to get,1,2,17,0,0,3,4,1,0
involved which is kind of a plus creaming butter and sugar together makes,1,1,13,0,0,4,3,0,0
quite a fabulous cupcake but sometimes you just want quick and easy and to,1,1,14,0,0,1,1,1,0
barely even need to use a mixer i mean basically like a box mix but not you,1,1,17,0,0,4,3,0,0
know,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0
these are those cupcakes the og cupcake was that way too but used,1,0,13,0,0,3,3,1,0
butter and were a little denser these cupcakes use oil and are lighter,2,1,13,0,0,4,3,1,0
we ve got the usual suspects in this cupcake starting with the dry,1,2,13,0,0,2,4,1,0
ingredients all purpose flour sugar baking powder and salt easy common,1,1,11,0,0,4,2,0,0
ingredients that you should totally have in your pantry already mix em all,1,1,13,0,0,2,2,0,0
together and set em aside,2,1,5,0,0,1,2,0,0
next are the wet ingredients milk vegetable oil vanilla extract and eggs,1,2,12,0,0,6,1,0,0
the oil is the fat component instead of butter and in my opinion tends to,1,1,15,0,0,4,2,0,0
make a more moist cake that stays moist for longer totally true for these,1,1,14,0,0,2,2,0,0
cupcakes the milk i typically use 2 adds to the structure of the cake in,1,1,15,1,1,5,2,1,0
addition to adding moisture milk adds fluff and i love some fluff i used a,1,1,15,0,0,5,4,0,0
full tablespoon of vanilla extract to make sure there s plenty of delicious,1,1,13,0,0,4,1,1,0
vanilla flavor then the eggs add more moisture structure and flavor i,1,1,12,0,0,6,1,0,0
switched it up in these and went with whole eggs instead of egg whites no,1,1,15,0,0,2,3,0,0
more egg yolks getting wasted here,0,1,6,0,0,2,2,0,0
once the wet and dry ingredients are combined the water is added,2,0,12,0,0,3,4,0,0
there s so much moisture in these cupcakes,0,2,8,0,0,2,1,1,0
i love them,0,0,3,0,0,1,1,0,0
i m a big big fan of,1,0,7,0,0,2,1,0,0
their ease of making their flavor and moisture they use such simple,1,1,12,0,0,4,2,0,0
ingredients that you likely already have in your pantry too score,0,1,11,0,0,2,2,0,0
when,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
topped with my favorite vanilla buttercream these vanilla cupcakes really are,1,1,11,0,0,4,2,1,0
a dream,0,1,2,0,0,1,0,0,0
they were a big hit in our house and i hope you love them as much as,1,0,17,0,0,2,4,0,0

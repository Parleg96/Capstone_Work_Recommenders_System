how to make moist chocolate cupcake recipe,0,0,7,0,0,3,1,1,0
moisture comes from rich ingredients that are high in fat so use full fat,1,0,14,0,0,4,2,0,0
ingredients use whole milk or buttermilk instead of fat free or low fat milk,1,1,14,0,0,4,1,0,0
use butter instead of oil although today s recipe is an exception and,1,1,13,0,0,5,2,0,0
requires oil,2,1,2,0,0,1,1,0,0
what makes best homemade fluffy cupcakes,0,2,6,0,0,2,1,1,0
that s a result of the air bubbles that you whip into the batter that end up expanding in the oven during baking however if the batter is over mixed those bubbles end up collapsing and the cupcakes don t fully rise and can sink too that s why you should only mix the cake batter until just combined,1,0,59,0,0,10,15,1,0
also measure ingredients properly because baking is science and those measurements and ingredients combine together to create the best fluffy texture,2,1,21,0,0,7,3,0,0
can you freeze cupcakes,0,2,4,0,0,1,1,1,0
yes unfrosted cupcakes can be stored in an air tight sealed freezer bag or,1,0,14,0,0,4,4,1,0

american buttercream frosting this is super sweet and will easily balance the rich and intense chocolate flavor,1,2,17,0,0,4,3,0,0
marshmallow frosting if you are fond of s mores you need to give this a shot,1,1,16,0,0,4,4,0,0
cream cheese frosting another classic frosting that works on pretty much all cakes and cupcakes it s not as sweet and has a subtle tanginess,1,1,25,0,0,7,4,1,0
white chocolate buttercream frosting this is a great way to incorporate white chocolate in these cupcakes,1,1,16,0,0,5,3,1,0
homemade whipped cream make it at home or just use cool whip it s the least sweet and the simplest of all the icings,2,1,24,0,0,5,4,0,0

chocolate chip cupcakes stir in 1/3 cup mini chocolate chips in the cupcake batter and also top off the frosted cupcakes with mini chocolate chips,1,1,25,1,2,12,2,1,0
chocolate peanut butter cupcakes pair these cupcakes with peanut butter frosting and a drizzle of melted peanut butter and finally top off with chopped roasted peanuts,1,1,26,0,0,13,3,1,0
mini cupcakes use a mini cupcake pan to make smaller cupcakes watch them closely while baking to prevent them from becoming over baked and dry,1,1,25,0,0,6,6,1,0
decorate it,0,1,2,0,0,1,0,0,0
i kept it simple and decorated with a simple swirl of frosting but you can toss chocolate chips chopped candies chocolate shreds sprinkles and even fresh flowers,2,0,27,0,0,7,6,0,0
tips and techniques,2,2,3,0,0,2,0,0,0
all ingredients must be at room temperature because this allows them to blend together smoothly and evenly,1,2,17,0,0,3,3,0,0
only use all purpose flour don t replace all purpose flour with any other flour because it does not yield the same good results i have various other flours including whole wheat and gluten free and neither tasted great the only other flour that still yielded good results was homemade cake flour,1,1,52,0,0,13,11,0,0
don t over mix cupcake batter because that will yield very tough cupcakes and there is a higher probability of them sinking in the center during baking,1,1,27,0,0,7,4,1,0
frost cool cupcakes allow the cupcakes to fully cool down before frosting them because that prevents the frosting from melting all over the cupcakes and making a mess,1,1,28,0,0,7,6,1,0
serve a crowd recipe can easily be doubled to serve more people you will have to bake in batches though if you don t have multiple ovens,1,1,27,0,0,6,8,0,0
oil vs butter typically i am a big fan of butter but in order to make these cupcakes fluffy oil has to be used to give them an airy texture butter tends to make them very dense,1,1,37,0,0,11,10,1,0
both baking powder and baking soda are required don t replace one with the other because that will alter the texture of this cake,1,1,24,0,0,5,5,0,0
use warm brewed coffee because if it s too hot it will start cooking the eggs in the batter it cannot be boiling hot,1,1,24,0,0,5,6,0,0
don t use dark chocolate this is with regards to cocoa powder because it makes the cupcakes too bitter,1,1,19,0,0,7,3,1,0
how to make homemade buttermilk,0,1,5,0,0,2,1,0,0
i know this is not an ingredient many of us have on hand all the time but no worries make a great buttermilk substitute at home by mixing together 1 cup whole milk with 1 tbsp vinegar or lemon juice let it sit for 5 minutes mix and then use in this recipe,1,0,53,1,3,13,8,1,0
don t replace buttermilk with whole milk because buttermilk adds a lot of moisture to the cupcakes and makes it super soft,2,1,22,0,0,8,3,1,0

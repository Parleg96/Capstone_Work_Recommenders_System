taste chocolate overload in the best possible waytexture the cupcakes are incredibly moist and tender without being too
delicate or crumbly and the frosting is just oh so light and creamy

is more involved it balances out in the endappearance gorgeous 
pros the best duhcons none

batches over a couple days after previous casual tests over the months to
finally nail the recipe

chocolate cupcake ingredients

best chocolate to use for chocolate cupcakes 

we can t make stellar homemade chocolate cupcakes without first considering
the chocolatethe cupcakes themselves use a whole 5 ounces of bittersweet
chocolate and dutch process cocoa powder for as much chocolate flavor as
possible make sure to use freshly chopped baking chocolate and not chocolate
chips which don t melt down as smoothly

do i have to use dutch process cocoa powderi do recommend you stick with the dutch process cocoa as it actually works
differently on a chemical level compared to regular natural cocoa you can
learn more about the differences between cocoa powders herecomparison of dutch process vs natural cocoa
powder data image/svg xml 3csvg 20xmlns http //wwww3org/2000/svg 20viewbox 0 200 201000 20667 3e 3c/svg 3ecomparison
of dutch process vs natural cocoa powder https //handletheheatcom/wp 
content/uploads/2020/09/different types of cocoa powdersjpg 

you can find it at many gourmet food stores like whole foods sur la table 
and williams sonoma one of the best surprising parts about dutch process
cocoa is that it almost always contains more cocoa butter fatthan your
typical grocery store cocoa powder this means more moisture richness and
chocolate flavorlearn more about cocoa powder fat here

if you must use regular unsweetened cocoa powder in this recipe then omit the
vinegar your cupcakes may be a little more dry if using something like
hershey s or nestle

the frosting uses melted chocolate for the most intense and pure chocolate
flavor possible i like to use semisweet but feel free to use milk or
bittersweet chocolate instead it s totally up to youmelted chocolate for homemade chocolate

how to make moist chocolate cupcakes 

1 this recipe calls for vegetable oil instead of melted butter i went back and forth on this for a bit and wound up choosing the oil because it creates an ultra moist texture and open slightly spongy crumb which is perfect for chocolate cupcakes for more details on how these two fats affect tenderness flavor and texture check out my butter vs oil in baking article
2 since oil is liquid at room temperature it gives a better sensation of moistness than butter does
3 be sure to also use full fat ingredients and don t reduce the sugar in this recipe sugar actually helps contribute to moistness if you can believe it4 lastly be sure not to accidentally over measure your flour and cocoa powder spoon both ingredients into their measuring cups then level off the excess with a knife or better yet use a digital kitchen scale check out my how to measure flour article for a step by step on how to accurately measure your dry ingredientsmoist chocolate cupcake before being

hot water and espresso powder in chocolate cupcakes

if you bake chocolate cake or cupcakes a lot you ve probably seen quite a few
recipes that utilize hot water or even hot coffee it helps to dissolve and
bloom the cocoa powder to bring out as much flavor with as few cocoa lumps
as possible in my best chocolate cupcake recipe i use a combination of hot
water and instant espresso powder the espresso simply enhances the chocolate
flavor without actually being perceptible

do i have to use espresso powderalternatively you could use hot coffee for the same effect or you can omit
it altogether if you d prefer

sugar s 

most of my initial recipe tests used only granulated sugar for the cupcakes
then i thought i d try to add in a bit of brown sugar the resulting
chocolate cupcakes were flavorful moist and slightly chewy perfecteggs

the more whole eggs a cake recipe has the richer it ll be i repeated one of
my favorite baking tricks and added in an egg yolk it works beautifully for
brownies and cookies so why not chocolate cupcakesit adds more richness 
chewiness and structure so the cupcake can stand up to a generous or heavy
frosting

is there an egg substitute for chocolate cupcakesi have yet to find an amazing egg substitute for this recipe my friend gemma
from bigger bolder baking has an excellent resource on egg substitutes

leavener

oh man this is where i encountered the most frustration i went back and
forth on this when i used both baking soda and baking powder the cupcakes
rose to a beautiful height while baking but then fell and collapsed slightly
as they cooled bummer that was too much leavener

i went back to only baking soda which is more effective per teaspoon than
baking powder but had to add vinegar to the recipe whywell because there
wasn t much acid for the baking soda to react with originally dutch process
cocoa powder has been neutralized of its acid so it was only the sour cream
and small amount of brown sugar for tall and light cupcakes we need enough
leavening so baking soda vinegar did the trick this is why you omit the
vinegar if you re using natural cocoa powder

flour

i tried testing with bread flour after seeing a few ultimate recipes
elsewhere that used it but found that all purpose worked just as well since
all purpose flour is more readily available i stuck with that to make things
easiest for you

sour cream

i find that sour cream adds such a lovely richness and balance of flavor to
cupcakes so i just had to include it here i think it definitely works best 
but full fat plain yogurt also makes a fine alternative in chocolate cupcakes

the chocolate buttercream frosting

when i originally published this recipe it used the more difficult chocolate
swiss meringue buttercream as the frosting although delicious it s more
advanced and requires more time and special equipment

in the interest of making this recipe easier but equally as delicious i
swapped in an american style chocolate buttercream that s made extra special
with two additions the frosting contains cooled chocolate ganache for extra
chocolate flavor and fudgy richness

for an extra smooth and rich frosting opt for organic powdered sugar and high
fat cocoa powder the full explanation for both is found here

my favorite cupcake tools 

cupcake liners these ones are my favorite for cupcakes that don t stick to the liner
piping tip i used the ateco 828 piping tip for swirling on the chocolate frosting on these cupcakes any large open star tip will workpiping bags i love these ones

how to store chocolate cupcakes 

cupcakes can be stored in an airtight container at room temperature for up to
1 day

can you freeze cupcakesif storing for longer than a week wrap unfrosted cupcakes individually in
plastic wrap this prevents freezer burn and taste transference place
cupcakes inside a freezer bag on a shelf in your freezer where they won t get
smashed freeze for up to 3 months

unwrap the cupcakes and allow to defrost at room temperature for about 1 to 2
hours more details on how to freeze and make desserts ahead of time in my
free make ahead baking guide

recipe notes

cupcake yield will depend on the size of your muffin tin cavities if they re
smaller you may need two pans to make 15 total cupcakes you can use 1/2 cup
hot strongly brewed coffee in place of the espresso powder hot water if
using natural cocoa powder omit the vinegar for the frosting opt for
organic powdered sugar made with tapioca starch such as wholesome instead of
cornstarch for a smoother silkier texture

do you happen to know how much batter is best to put in a standard sized tinoftentimes with chocolate cupcakes they rise excessively and i have overflow
i use 1/4 c batter with cupcake recipes but your recommendation is to fill
them higher than i typically would

hi jennifer3/4 full rose up beautifully for us but when you re not sure
about how much batter is best we recommend testing it out bake two cupcakes
prior to baking the entire batch one filled 2/3 full the other 3/4 full for
the designated time and see which you prefer then you re not messing up an
entire batch and can continue with baking i hope that helpsreply

hi marywhile we haven t tried that specifically these cupcakes hold up well
to a good amount of buttercream i m sure adding a filling will be completely
fine if you ve not made filled cupcakes before just a helpful hint to use
an apple corer to remove the center of the cupcakes it makes the process go
so smoothly and quicklyplease let me know if you have any other questions 
and let me know how your cupcakes turn outreply

i added more boiling water at the end to loosen up the batter because it was
like cookie doughthey did turn outonly thing i can think of that may have
been the problem was that i did not let the chocolate mixture stand for 5
minutes before mixing it until smooth it may have seized 
i thought that it was the amount of chocolate that i used because in your
intro you mentioned 4ounces and the actual recipe state 5 ounces
regardless they were finei will attempt againthankyoureply

look no farther this is the ultimate chocolate cupcake recipethe texture is
perfection light with a little bit of fudginess i top mine off with the
vanilla buttercream on this site and its a match made in heaven for those who
are not huge cocoa fans you may want to do 1/2 bittersweet and 1/2 milk
chocolate my husband doesn t like the burnt or otherwise bitter taste of
bittersweet and semisweet chocolate so that hack helps otherwise i m so
happy i found this thanks so much tessareply

hi sonnyso happy to hear how much you love this recipe yaythese cupcakes
have a very small dome almost flat as you can see in some of the pictures
above the recipe making them perfect for piping do you have an oven
thermometerif not i d highly recommend getting one just to ensure that
your oven is at the accurate temperature flatter cupcakes can also happen if
your leaveners are expired more details here if the mixture was overmixed
though you said the consistency was great so i don t think that s the case 
if the oven door was open too much or if too much batter was added to the
liner is it possible your liners were a little too fulli hope that helps
for your next batch but i m so glad you loved this recipethanks so much for
taking the time to comment

hi jenthe frosting uses melted chocolate for the most intense and pure
chocolate flavor possible we prefer to use semisweet but feel free to use
milk or bittersweet chocolate instead it s totally up to youyou won t need
to increase/reduce the amount of sugar but again use the type of chocolate
based on your personal preference just know that each chocolate will alter
the sweetness of the recipe i hope that helpsreply

i made the cupcake recipe it turned out great nice moist not crumbly
i just watched your video on natural vs dutch chocolate didn t think i
should put bkg soda in the recipe i find inconsistency in recipes that do or
don t have bkg soda or powder i plan to make your icing but today i made a
white chocolate butter cream for these cupcakes thanks for all your expertise
in teaching us bakers

so glad you enjoyed this recipe terrewhite chocolate buttercream would be
heavenly on these cupcakes yumhopefully i read your comment correctly but
i d recommend checking out our tips in the pink box above the recipe regarding
cocoa powder and what needs to be omitted if using natural rather than dutch
process tessa not only explains why she prefers using dutch process cocoa 
but also if you scroll down a bit she explains the necessity of the baking
soda under the leavener header i hope that helpsreply

hi shilpaso happy to having you following along and i m so excited for you
to try these cupcakesbe sure to tag tessa using the handletheheat so she
can see your finished cupcakes you re welcome to use a hand held mixer with
this recipe no problemand feel free to omit the espresso powder if you d
prefer it simply enhances the chocolate flavor though it does add a teensy
bit of caffeine enjoy your cupcakesreply

i have bad news to share today but also good newsi have bad news to share
today but also good news at the end 

a couple weeks ago you might have seen me talk about the dream come true
experience of publishing the ultimate cookie handbook and having it sell out
in 30 hours back in 2020

i also teased the launch of something exciting coming soon

well that exciting thing is no longer coming as soon as we d planned and now
i have to wait longer to even tell you what it is

so we were going to launch this brand new product in april but our inventory
got held up at the ports unexpectedly

we figured we d just delay the launch to may

then just before i left town for my 31st birthday trip at the end of march 
we got the bad news

the new secret product we have been working so hard on for the last year had a
packaging flaw

it took all my energy not to panic

you see we had conducted test shipments of the product as part of our due
diligence this is when we discovered a problem the packaging on the inside
didn t secure the products as well as it should ve resulting in the contents
moving around and the packaging itself becoming damaged in some cases

the idea of any of my beloved hth customers spending their hard earned money
on our new product only to open the box to see the contents haphazardly
shuffled around inside or damaged packaging i couldn t let that happen

this is when my inner perfectionist took over and we decided to postpone the
launch until fall so we could have time to correct the packaging issue in
order to give our customers the best possible experience

it wasn t an easy decision

but i know it was the right decision because i wouldn t be able to sleep at
night without knowing we had done everything we could to do right by you guys

so sadly you ll have to wait until after summer to learn what this new
product is but trust me it ll be worth the wait

and a few good things have come out of this challenge we now have extra
time to work on another project that we ve been planning to do for a while

and i m so excited that i ve even been having a hard time falling asleep at
night plus it s something we re able to launch in junei ll share more on that soon

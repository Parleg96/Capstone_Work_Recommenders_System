have you ever eaten a slice of red velvet cake and thought there s no way
this could get any betteror sliced off a silky piece of cheesecake and
thought this is the best honestly underrated dessert of all timethen boy
do we have a recipe for youif you love both red velvet cake and cheesecake 
this perfect sweet meets rich meets creamy concoction is bound to be your new
favorite dessert a red velvet filling is spiked with cocoa topped with a
creamy cheesecake layer and baked in a dark chocolate crust making a
wickedly delicious combination as far as preparation goes the cake will
require eight hours to chill so it s perfect to make in advance prep time is
a cool 20 minutes and then the oven will require a bit of baby sitting for
the first 10 minutes after that you just set it a forget it eight hours
later it s time to enjoyby rhonda y coker columbia south carolina

southern living recipes are usually my go to for when i want to try out
something new the recipes are typically well tested so you can follow the
recipe as written and end up with a great creation this is not the case wit
this recipe first off the recipe doesn t list red food coloring in the list
of ingredients you have the watch the video to see that it calls for 2
bottles of red food coloring it s up to you determine the volume of 2
bottles my main issue with the recipe is that the bake temperature seems to
be wrong the recipe calls for 10 minutes at 325 degrees and then to reduce
the temp to 300 and cook for 1 hour 15 minutes i decided to use a water bath
to reduce chance of cracking after baking at 300 degrees 1 hour and 25
minutes the cake was still very wet and not even close to being set i
increased the temp to 325 and baked for another 40 minutes before it was done
so after 2 hours 5 minutes and increasing the temp to 325 it was finally
baked fortunately the extra long bake time did not negatively affect the
taste

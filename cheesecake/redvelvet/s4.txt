how to make moist red velvet cakeit is very easy to over bake a cake moist cakes are my favorite

i ve baked quite a few red velvet cakes and tested recipes

here are some tips to make the perfect moist red velvet cake layers 

sift the flour
use buttermilk makes the cake moist 
i recommend that you use oil in order to produce crumby and soft cake instead of butter that makes tough dense cakes
do not over mix the batter beat until the dry and wet ingredients are just combined
it is important that you preheat the oven for at least 20 minutes before you place the cake pans for baking do not over bake the cake bake until toothpick inserted comes out cleana slice cut into a red velvet

do you need to bake the cheesecake layer in a water baththe short answer is no but if you d like a fluffier softer and moister
cheesecake go ahead and bake it in a water bath

i believe that the whole water bath set up is extra work that is not workt it 
if you bake the cheesecake at 300 325 f and don t bake it for a very long
periods of time

sometimes my springform pans leak and it causes extra frustration and waste of
ingredients

how to decorate this easy red velvet cheesecake cakeyou can use a piping bag with a tip of your choice to decorate the cake

even if you leave it plain just covered in cream cheese frosting it will
still look beautiful the frosting does not need to be smooth

top with fresh berries of your choice

you can also reserve some red velvet cake crumbs from the cake layers when
you trim the domes and sprinkle the crumbs on top of the cake

this was fun to make i sliced the cake like a reviewer suggested so that i
had 4 quarter circles and so had a nice layer look when sliced but the taste
was only average to me i had some neighbors over to eat it and they seemed to
like it it got nice and firm in refrigerator thanks debeland

this is my favorite recipe i ve ever madei cut the red velvet in half at
it s diameter drying out the cake in the oven then blending it into fine
crumbs with a food processor i added about a tablespoon more butter to the
crust and packed it into the bottom of a 9 inch pan instead of 10 i then cut
the other half in half so if i used the whole cake i would have had quarters 
and then i cut those down the middle as if i was making a layer cake instead
of cubing it after i put my first layer of the cheesecake in the pan i
arranged the sliced cake so it covered the surface completely and then put the
remaining cheesecake over it the only problem i had was that it didn t really
set in the fridge but i was using light cream cheese so that may have been
the problem i would definitely make this again as it got eaten in two dayshttps //imagesvcmeredithcorpio/v3/mm/image url https 3a 2f 2fcam image

this was very yummy i used a red velvet cake mix instead of making one from
scratch the cream cheese mixture is what makes this though i would like to
try it with some other cake flavors as wellhttps //imagesvcmeredithcorpio/v3/mm/image url https 3a 2f 2fcam image

this is complicated i just used the cheesecake portion of this recipe and
it s a 5where i changed this recipe is that i made the bottom a layer of
red velvet cake not a crust i used this recipe 
http //allrecipescom/recipe/9295/red velvet cake/ made it in two layers and
used the other layer cut in pieces for the filling this cheesecake is so
light and fluffy and not really sweet i m not a huge fan of no bake
cheesecakes but this filling is great

i used dark brown sugar instead of white and added 1/3 cup of coffee liqueur
to the cake mix i also used 10 fat plain yogurt instead of milk i also
added 1/4 cup coffee liqueur to the cream cheese mix it turned out great 
very moist the liqueur did not overwhelm the other ingredients everyone at
work wanted the recipehttps //imagesvcmeredithcorpio/v3/mm/image url https 3a 2f 2fcam image

deliciouswife i loved it i didn t have a 10 spring form pan so i used a
9 was fine i had a little extra red velvet cake left over i could use for
decoration plan any possible red velvet cake shapes you may want before
cutting the half with the strips wife loved the fact this desert light
tasting and not as heavy as most of the death by chocolate type cakes i
tend to make be sure not to overcook the red velvet cake i almost did by
cooking a little longer than called for personally i didn t think of
cheesecake when tasting it but it is very goodbaker girl

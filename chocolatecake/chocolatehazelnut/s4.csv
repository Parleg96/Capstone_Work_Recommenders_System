this cake was absolutely exquisite everything about this cake was delectable,1,2,11,0,0,3,2,0,0
i particularly enjoyed that this wonderfully chocolate cake was not too heavy,1,1,12,0,0,1,2,0,0
like another reviewer mentioned i recommend letting your cream warm to room,1,1,12,0,0,4,3,0,0
temperature before adding it to the chocolate or simply heat it in the,1,1,13,0,0,2,2,0,0
microwave for a few seconds to warm this will prevent the chocolate from,1,1,13,0,0,3,2,0,0
seizing one other note when i chilled the filling for 30 minutes it was way,1,1,15,1,2,5,3,0,0
too stiff to spread but maybe my refrigerator was too cold in any case i,1,1,15,0,0,3,2,0,0
would skip that step next time all in all this was a wonderful recipe and i,1,1,16,0,0,4,2,0,0
received nothing but rave reviews,0,1,5,0,0,2,2,0,0

this is a great idea for a cake mix cake although i would suggest making the,1,2,16,0,0,4,4,0,0
devil s food cake mix to the specifications listed under the too much,1,1,13,0,0,5,2,0,0
chocolate cake recipe on this site it uses more oil and some sour cream and,1,1,15,0,0,6,1,0,0
insures that the cake will stay moist,0,1,7,0,0,3,1,0,0
hazelnuts are kind of pricey and this,1,0,7,0,0,3,1,0,0
was a tester cake so i used toasted almonds instead for frosting i looked at,1,1,15,0,0,3,4,0,0
the cool whipped frosting recipe from this site but used 8 oz of fresh,1,1,14,1,1,4,3,0,0
cream instead of cool whip i also would recommend if using that frosting,1,1,13,0,0,3,3,0,0
recipe that you only use half the amount of the pudding mix and that you buy,1,1,16,0,0,4,2,0,0
instant white chocolate pudding rather than vanilla the vanilla gave my cake,1,1,12,0,0,4,2,0,0

delicious cake,0,2,2,0,0,1,0,0,0
i only had two 9 cake pans so i made a 2 instead of 3 layer,1,0,16,1,3,4,2,0,0
cake so the extra filling i spread on top of the cake before frosting it i,1,1,16,0,0,5,2,0,0
didn t have any problem with letting the filling chill completely before,1,1,12,0,0,5,2,0,0
spreading it as some reviewers mentioned also be aware that if you make the,1,1,14,0,0,1,4,0,0
frosting as written not with cool whip it won t be sweet just,1,1,13,0,0,1,4,0,0
creamy/nutty it can be a nice touch to offset all the sweetness of the cake,1,1,15,0,0,4,2,0,0
and filling but just be aware of that taste a little while you re whipping,1,1,15,0,0,1,4,0,0

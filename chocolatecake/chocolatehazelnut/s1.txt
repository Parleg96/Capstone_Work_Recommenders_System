the inspiration for this cake came from a new product from sprouts farmers
market that i m pretty excited about organic hazelnut spreadif you love chocolate and hazelnut or love that other brand of hazelnut
spread you must try thisi m going to dare to say that sprouts organic hazelnut spread is even better
than the brands you may have tried beforeit s just so perfectly creamy and flavorfuli know this is going to be a
staple in our house nowof course i ve come to expect sprouts brand products to be exceptional in
flavor and performance and always at super reasonable pricesand when i picked up my jar ok i bought two jars of hazelnut spread i knew
i could head right to sprouts bulk bins to find some gorgeous raw hazelnuts as
the perfect finishing element for a chocolate and hazelnut dessertchocolate hazelnut cake ingredients https //wwwglorioustreatscom/wp

of course my kids love sprouts hazelnut spread simply on toast but i wanted
to elevate this delicious spread a bit morethis chocolate hazelnut cake is perfectly rich flavorful and delicious and
i m already dreaming of more gorgeous desserts to show off my new favorite
hazelnut spreadi shared some of this cake with a friend and the next day she texted me
asking for the recipechocolate hazelnut cake recipe https //wwwglorioustreatscom/wp 
content/uploads/2017/10/chocolate hazelnut cake recjpg 

you ll find the full recipe below but let me walk you through the decorating
just a bit 

make sure the cake layers are fully cooled before you start to decorate i
like to wrap each layer in plastic wrap and put in the freezer for at least 1
hour or up to a couple days before frosting so the cake is nice and firm
while i m decorating it the cake will defrost quite quickly and perfectly
soft to eat 

once you ve added a layer of frosting between each cake layer and you re
ready to frost the outside of the cake start with a thin layer of frosting
called a crumb coat to seal in the crumbs this layer does not need to be
perfect and it s fine if you can see the cake through this layer a bit put
the entire cake in the freezer for at least 15 minutes for the crumb coat to
firm up

add the second layer of frosting this time you can spend a bit more time
making it as smooth as you wish

for the frosting style pictured use a small off set spatula held horizontally
and drag it through the frosting while slowly turning the cake preferably on
a cake turn table spiral up the cake as the cake spins

add the layer of hazelnut spread on top listed below in the recipe then add
chopped hazelnuts

add some reserved frosting to a piping bag and pipe swirls of frosting around
the top rim of the cake if desiredchocolate cake with whipped nutella

ingredients



for the cake

2 cups sugar
1 3/4 cups all purpose flour
3/4 cup unsweetened cocoa powder best quality available
1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
1 1/2 teaspoons baking soda
1 teaspoon salt
3 eggs
3/4 cup whole milk or use skim milk and add a little cream
1/2 cup vegetable oil
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
3/4 cup very hot water or hot coffee

for the frosting

3 cups heavy whipping cream
1 cup powdered sugar divided
8 oz cream cheese 1 package
3/4 cup sprouts organic hazelnut spread
1 teaspoon vanilla extract

garnish

2 tablespoons chocolate chips
3 tablespoons sprouts organic hazelnut spread
1/4 cup chopped hazelnuts
12 15 whole hazelnuts additional

instructions



bake the cake

heat oven to 350 f

prepare cake pans by rubbing the sides of the pans with a little oil or butter and dusting with flour line bottoms of pans with parchment paper

in a large mixing bowl the bowl of an electric mixer stir together sugar flour cocoa baking powder baking soda and salt

add eggs milk oil and vanilla beat on medium speed for one minute

stir in hot water or coffee the batter will be thin don t worry this is right 

divide batter evenly between prepared pans

bake until the top of the cake is smooth and has a slight dome and a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean i baked the cake shown in three 7 pans and baked them about 30 minutes you will need to adjust the bake time based on the pans you choose

cool completely before frosting i like to cool the cakes at room temperature a bit then wrap in plastic wrap and freeze until cold and firm 30 minutes or up to a couple days 

prepare the frosting

chill your mixing bowl and beater s in the freezer for 5 minutes this will help the whipping cream whip up nice and quickly

pour the heavy cream into the chilled bowl then beat until it begins to thicken slowly add half 1/2 cup of the powdered sugar while mixing continue to beat until the cream has almost doubled in volume and is nice and fluffy

remove whipped cream from mixing bowl into another bowl and set in the fridge

in the mixing bowl empty but no need to clean fully add the cream cheese beat until smooth

add the remaining 1/2 cup powdered sugar and mix until fully combined

add the hazelnut spread to the smooth cream cheese and blend until fully combined add vanilla and blend

retrieve the whipped cream from the fridge and add one large scoop about a cup of whipped cream into the mixing bowl with the hazelnut spread/cream cheese mixture blend slowly using the whisk attachment until combined

add the remaining whipped cream to the bowl and use a spatula to gently fold/stir the whipped cream into the hazelnut mixture

fill and frost your prepared cooled cake as desired you should have plenty of frosting to cover the cake and some remaining for decorative touches to be added later move frosted cake to the freezer if you plan to add chocolate glaze recipe follows 

garnish

once the cake is frosted if desired add a chocolate hazelnut glaze by combining 2 t chocolate chip and 3 t hazelnut spread in a small bowl and microwave at 50 power 30 seconds at a time until mostly melted stir to combine cool slightly then pour onto the top of the frosted and chilled cake spread almost but not quite to the edge top chocolate layer with chopped hazelnuts

if desired add remaining hazelnut whipped cream frosting to a piping bag fitted with a 1m tip and add decorative swirls as pictured around the top edge of the cake top each swirl with a whole hazelnut

keep the cake in the fridge until ready to serve keep any remaining cake in the fridge

notes

the cake shown was baked in 7 round cake pans if you are using 8 or 9 pans
feel free to just make two layers of cake

if you are not making a 7 3 layer cake you can reduce the frosting recipe
as follows 2 cup heavy cream 1/2 cup powdered sugar 4oz 1/2 package 
cream cheese 1/2 cup hazelnut spread 1 teaspoon vanilla

yes those details are in the notes section of the recipe i baked the cake
shown in 7 pans if you are using 8 pans you may do two or three layers but
the layers will be a bit thinner than those pictured if you do three layers

i tried to make this cake today while the cake part came out wonderful my
frosting was more of a mousse than frosting i followed the directions
carefully i make all my frosting from scratch they don t sell it where i
live so i am stumped as to what went wrong the flavor was wonderful though
any advicereplyhttps //securegravatarcom/avatar/9d611162b95c7e5ade69f7e4538c431d s 48 d https 3a 2f 2fwwwglorioustreatscom 2fwp content 2fthemes 2fglorioustreatsr 2fimages 2fgravatarpng r g glory says

hi amy so glad you gave the recipe a tryas far as i can tell you did
everything perfectlythis frosting is a whipped creamed based frosting so it
should be very light and fluffy and not at all like a traditional buttercream
in fact if you have any frosting leftover you could serve it just in a small
glass as a mousse now the only unknown is the homemade hazelnut spread 
since i have not ever made that myself i really have no idea if that would
effect the consistency

hey glory did you trim the layer tops to level themby the way i did 15
times the batter recipe and this made a beautiful 9 inch layer for a triple
layer cake happy thanksgivingreplyhttps //securegravatarcom/avatar/9d611162b95c7e5ade69f7e4538c431d s 48 d https 3a 2f 2fwwwglorioustreatscom 2fwp content 2fthemes 2fglorioustreatsr 2fimages 2fgravatarpng r g glory says

hi teresa i didn t have to trim the tops because once they cooled they were
pretty level if you have a bit of a dome wrap and chill the cake layers in
the freezer then once chilled they will be easier to level thanks for
letting me know the proportions you used for a 9 cake it sounds like you re
going to have some happy friends or family this thanksgivingolder comments

of websites including time and huffpost what s more is that the most
common birthday in all of september is september 16 and if you re curious
like i was the least common birthday is february 29 with the second least
common being december 25close up of chocolate hazelnut cake showing crumbled cookies and toasted

so anyway enough of my rambling about birthdays except for the fact that i
want to tell you this cake makes a gorgeous celebration cakeand with
birthdays being a pretty great reason to celebrate by extension it makes an
absolutely fabulous birthday cake

i don t know about you but personally i always feel like i was cheated if my
birthday cake doesn t include chocolate of some kind whether it s the cake 
frosting filling or topping

this deep rich and dense chocolate cake is almost fudgy it also boasts a
velvety chocolate ganache dark chocolate bahlsen waffeleten cookies and
toasted hazelnuts on top

it s a chocolate hazelnut lovers paradisechocolate hazelnut cake with

the flavor of hazelnut is a classic but wonderful accent to chocolate here
additionally i used pear butter for a hint of warm spices

bahlsen waffeletten cookies play a double role in this recipe half a box is
crumbled into powder with the hazelnut meal and the other half is coarsely
chopped and used as garnish on top

this cake is really impressive too it looks like something straight from a
bakery but is actually quite easy to make there are no hard techniques to
master or tricks needed but bring this cake to a birthday celebration and
you ll be a rock star especially with chocoholicschocolate hazelnut cake recipe on cake stand with vintage knife and plates

ingredients

1x2x3x

cake 

3/4 cup hazelnut meal
1/4 cup unsweetened cocoa powder
3/4 teaspoon sea salt
1/8 teaspoon cream of tartar
1/2 3 1/2 oz/100 g box bahlsen waffeletten dark cookies
3/4 pound 60 cacoa chocolate broken into pieces
3/4 cup unsalted butter plus more for greasing the pan
1/2 cup smooth pear butter
1 1/2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract
1 teaspoon hazelnut extract
6 large eggs
3/4 cup light brown sugar lightly packed

ganache 

1/4 pound 60 cacoa chocolate broken into pieces
1/2 cup heavy cream

toppings 

1/2 3 1/2 oz/100 g box bahlsen waffeletten dark cookies coarsely chopped
1/4 cup hazelnuts toasted and coarsely chopped

instructions



preheat oven to 350f generously grease a 9 inch springform pan with butter line the bottom with a round piece of parchment paper set aside

add the hazelnut meal cocoa powder sea salt cream of tartar and 1/2 box bahlsen waffeletten cookies to a food processor and pulse until the cookies are completely crumbled set aside

melt the chocolate and butter together in a microwave or double boiler stir in the pear butter vanilla extract and hazelnut extract mix in the hazelnut meal mixture

use a handheld electric mixer to beat the eggs and brown sugar together in a large bowl until they re pale golden light and fluffy and nearly doubled in volume about 10 minutes

stir 1/3 of the fluffy egg mixture into the chocolate mixture once incorporated fold in another 1/3 of the egg mixture until nearly completely incorporated and then fold in the remaining 1/3 of the egg mixture be careful not to over mix or deflate the eggs completely a few streaks of egg in the batter is fine

pour the batter into the prepared springform pan bake until the cake is set and a wooden pick inserted in the center comes out with just a couple crumbs do not bake until a wooden pick comes out clean because the cake will be overcooked about 55 to 60 minutes

straight out of the oven transfer the cake to a wire rack to cool completely to room temperature once cooled cover the cake and transfer it to the fridge to chill for 4 hours or overnight once chilled invert the cake onto a cake platter and peel off the parchment paper

for the ganache melt the chocolate and heavy cream together in a microwave or double boiler just until the chocolate is melted being careful not to overheat and gently stir to combine let the ganache cool a couple minutes and then starting in the center spread it across the top of the inverted cake letting it drip down the sides add the toppings decoratively to the top

chill the cake until the ganache sets about 1 hour before slicing and serving

faith s tips

instead of bahlsen waffeletten dark cookies you can use any chocolate wafer cookies you like
store any leftovers wrapped in the fridge for up to 5 days

all over the internet in the last few months i decided to give it a try and i
was surprised how easy this cake and how good it is all you need is some
cookies/biscuits baking powder and milk the result is soft fluffy and
delicious cake if you are making this cake with oreo cookies the cake will
taste like oreo

i used double stuff oreos plus chips ahoychoc chip cookies and the batter was
very wetprobably due to the stuffingso i just crushed up a lot more
cookies until the batter felt almost normal thickness came out absolutely
delicious like a cake browniebut i did have to bake it nearly 15 mins
longerreply

yes leave the cream in the oreos biscuits i would use milk over water because
the flour mixture used to bake biscuits binds better with milk use
alternative milk if not cows milk unsure how it would taste mind i added
100g mcvities plain digestive and about 250g oreos this cake turned out
amazing because i used plain digestive it wasn t as sweet as it would ve
been with choc locate digestives but it was fine for us particularly as we
added ganache topping it was beautifully moist a
